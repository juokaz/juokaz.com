<h2>Quotes</h2>
Some quotes from people who have recently attended my talks

<blockquote>This was the talk that I learned the most from, I find it fascinating that he can debug just by correlating data points across many systems. I plan to start using the techniques ASAP. - about "You Can't Optimize What You Can't Measure" at Lone Star PHP conference</blockquote>

<blockquote>I really like the way Joe presents his message. His slides are laid out well and he does a great job speaking to the crowd interactively without just reading off slides the entire time. With the real-world examples he shares, it was very helpful. - about "You Can't Optimize What You Can't Measure" at Lone Star PHP conference</blockquote>

<blockquote>Presentation and content were wonderful. Thank you - about "Virtualized Development" at Lone Star PHP conference</blockquote>

<blockquote>One of the better talks of DPC13. Very fun, entertaining and interesting. Used good examples from his own experience, and showed some good code examples. And a lot of tips what to do, and not to do. - about "Growing spiders to crawl the web" at Dutch PHP conference</blockquote>

<blockquote>Great speaker presenting great content backed up with some real life experience. Everything a talk needs!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Really enjoyed the talk and the humorous approach. Will most certainly be implementing statsd sometime in the near future. Liked the way stats were correlated to deployments that would be a big win for me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Really good talk. Liked the examples on how to make a spider act more like a human being. Presentation was good, lots of good examples, mixed with a good dose of humor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Interesting and insightful. The talk was delivered very professionally.</blockquote>
