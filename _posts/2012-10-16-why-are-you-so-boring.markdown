title: Why are you so boring?
location: London, UK
excerpt: By far the most irritating question I get is 'Why?'. Or 'Why did you ...?' to be exact. There is something wrong with our society, or me finding this wrong, that everything one does have to have some sort of background for it and that he should explain that to others. The last bit is the important one - there is always a reason, but why does it even matter, you are not my mom.

By far the most irritating question I get is "Why?". Or "Why did you ...?" to be exact. There is something wrong with our society, or me finding this wrong, that everything one does have to have some sort of background for it and that he should explain that to others. The last bit is the important one - there is always a reason, but why does it even matter, you are not my mom.

The sad part of this, is that the question "why" comes with an answer "because". And "because" is one hundred percent times an excuse. You were busy. You aren't good at sports. You have kids. All kind of nonsense. The way I put this, putting kids and nonsense close together, has probably already made you angry. Well, that's not the point. The point is that the things you have in life which take up time are very unlikely taking up 24 hours of it, because having time actually means allocating it to things you want to be doing.

I remember the times while I was still riding a motorcycle, something I'm planning to resume as soon as I [settle down](/blog/living-homeless) somewhere, every time I would go somewhere dressed in a leather jacket, people, usually men, would congratulate me on how awesome it is that I'm a *biker*. Usually also implying that they wish they were riding one today or when they were young. Ignoring the cash question, what was stopping them from getting one? Inability to go and do the things they want to be doing, most likely caused by a lack of motivation or one only as strong as to have that idea, but not actually do something about it.

This notion of having goals, talking about them and not actually ever doing them has been studied quite extensively. Especially when it comes to such things like motorcycles. Or any of that sort of things - it's perceived as something really cool, somewhat dangerous, but definitely something one has to do. And some people do do it, but not that many. I think *Derek Sivers*, awesome dude I had a pleasure to have a pint with once, explains the reason very well. Again, ignoring the bullshit one might reason it with, it as always boils down to psychological reasons.

The biggest problem with motorcycles is the fact that it's hard to convince ones family and friends that you are not going to kill yourself on the first day. A very reasonable hesitation. However for most of the things, there is nothing blocking them. It's the fact that people assume that there are going to be roadblocks to achieve something, which is causing them to not even try. But life is all about roadblocks, that's the fun part of it as it creates a sense of achievement once you go through them.

Some months ago I met one of the founders of [Moshsuits](http://www.moshsuits.com), the most important lesson from that was the reason why they started that business. Because all men are idiots. This for me is one of the best reasonings for a business idea. It points to a fundamental behavioral symptom of men - they do stupid things for fun. This is so true, that I bought one of their suits and had some really fun and epic moments with it. Sadly though, this still only applies to a small portion of men - you don't see everyone walking in a morpshuit, do you?

I can't remember where I've seen this first, but the idea is that as people get older, they loose their imagination. Or childishness if you would call it that. Wait... childishness? Yes, I think children are ace - coming up with the most random things, doing them and moving on. That's how I do things, and that's how I think the ability to be creative can be preserved. I live and work on things which are not even remotely boring, but at the same time I have to always come up with new things. How do I try to do it? By keeping my mind fresh.

And the way you keep ones mind fresh and also broad, is by doing new things. Lots of them. All the time. A conference once asked me what I would advice developers to learn next - I was really surprised seeing other speakers suggesting various tech tools, languages and frameworks. A terrible idea. What you want to learn, and what I suggested then, is say martial arts. Or how to cook properly. These are the sort of skills which would benefit you as a whole, not just professionally. Actually scratch that - it will benefit you professionally too, because everything you learn allows to do better things across everything you do.

So when a person asks me why did I got rid of most of my hair to get a Mohawk, I feel sad for him. Why not? It's the easiest thing one can do to try something new - at the end of a day, if you won't like it, it will grow back. I did it because I wanted to. Done. I was DJing at an event back in Edinburgh for a crowd of students because I wanted to. I got my neck tattooed recently because why not? Actually that bit about a tattoo is not true. Yet.

There are so many possibilities and opportunities every day, but it's always the easiest to sit on a sofa and do nothing. And most people do. And I'm not in a position to teach or show you anything, but think about it for a second. If you find yourself questioning others too often, maybe you yourself are a very boring person. Which would be fine, there are plenty of fun people for me to hang out with anyway, but I think you'd be better off trying to approach things differently - by doing things you feel like doing. That second. Because time is the most valuable thing.

I don't think there should any reason why ones does something - you can do whatever you want. Period. If you can't - I'm very sorry for you - because I (still?) can and it's brilliant.
