title: €100 bet on him being honest
location: Selbyville, DE, USA
excerpt: I was waiting for my train in one of the Paris train stations a few months ago when a Scottish guy came to me. He was in his fifties, sporting an almost-homeless look and was looking distressed. He came to me to tell his story of how he fell asleep on a train and woke up robbed. Not a very unusual event while traveling on trains. Because of that, he had no money to comeback home and because he was living in Norway the British embassy would not cover his journey. Thus he was in need of money.

I was waiting for my train in one of the Paris train stations a few months ago when a Scottish guy came to me. He was in his fifties, sporting an almost-homeless look and was looking distressed. He came to me to tell his story of how he fell asleep on a train and woke up robbed. Not a very unusual event while traveling on trains. Because of that, he had no money to comeback home and because he was living in Norway the British embassy would not cover his journey. Thus he was in need of money.

I knew he was lying. Yet, I gave him as much as he asked for and farewelled on a safe journey. He even gave me his contact details and his wife's phone which I was supposed to call the next day and arrange how he is going to pay me back. I did call her the next day. No one picked up. I googled his name then; apparently I wasn't the first idiot who has met him. He even had a website created for him by some journalists so people could share their stories. Mostly complain about the scamming though.

When I was talking to him I couldn't stop thinking what if all of his story is actually true. Surely I asked quite a few questions to check his story and it sounded really convincing, or at least well though out. Last year I had my car stuck in a middle of nowhere in Tuscany mountains in Italy, I had to find people who would believe this to help me out. And I did. While the money I handed to the guy was almost definitely not going to get back to me I wish he was telling the truth.

Because if he was telling the truth and everyone he would ask help for though he was scamming them... you don't want to end up in that situation. I bid on him being honest. On a slim chance that he was indeed in a need of help. He wasn't really, but I would do the same any day. One day a person is actually going to need something. I hope they meet me. Having traveled the world I've seen how many bad things could happen and how much convincing it takes to make others care.

While going to my friend's house in London I was walking from an underground station using my phone to direct me. Don't use your phones for this when traveling. Of course it had to die with about a mile to go. Nowadays we trust the devices so much that I didn't even bother to remember the address. Luckily I had my laptop with me so I could at least charge the phone. Standing under the roof of a bus stop, rain pouring hard outside I realized that my laptop was dead too.

Where do you find electricity at night in a suburb filled with people's houses and no Starbucks in sight? I thought about going to a random house and knocking on the door. To ask for electricity. What a strange thing to ask for. But then I realized that most people are going to come up with the most obscene explanations why they couldn't help me. His wife is giving birth to a baby boy while he is having to defend from the recently showed up sharks while they are attacking his family with their lasers attached to their backs.

So I walked around a bit, eventually finding a pizza restaurant. I walked in; me, my big international-flight ready travel bag and a mohawk drenched in rain. Instead of getting something to eat I asked if they had a power socked I could use to charge my phone. They didn't. Yes, they actually said they had none available. In *London*. What's up with those sharks everywhere? I questioned their position and eventually the manager offered to take my phone to his office to charge it there. I ate something decent, got my finally charged phone and went to my friend's place to sleep.

That friend had to rescue me the next time I was traveling to her house. I had just landed in the Heathrow airport just to realize I had no money. I was broke. Not in a sense of having no disposable money, but in a sense of as far as ATMs and card machines were concerned my bank cards were all blocked. I guess that does count as no disposable money. I had traveled so much before getting there that the anti-fraud systems have automatically blocked them. Oh, and another one was not working because I forgot my PIN code a week before while trying to pay for a dinner. My friend started calling me a *diva* that night. Yet called me a cab.

We are living in a world now where getting someone to help you is hard. Too many people would try to use your helpfulness to trick you. Too many people just don't give a shit. Too many people can't lift their faces from a phone screen.

How nice are you going to be to others?

Sending aid to the 3rd world countries seems like a such waste of money to a lot. Big countries filled with low-pay individuals are choosing to spend billions to help out some country thousands of miles away. Why wouldn't just give out that aid to you own people? Maybe because they don't live in a place with the closest water source being 50 miles away and life-expectancy of 40, you lazy moron. World as a whole can't just focus on the thriving countries and let the other ones survive through natural selection.

It could. It could also choose to ignore all the political wars and let them figure out between each other. But yet we choose to dump all this money to save others. It is extremely inefective, most of it doesn't change anything or doesn't even reach its goal, but most people are willing to spend say 1% of the country budget to try. To naively try to see if this would work. And it does work, it keeps those places going. If only that budget was 1% though, it is way, way smaller.

This is why we have open source. It's doing something not to gain an imediate affect to *you*, but to just do it. Naively expecting that it is going to do great to others. Open source software for me is one of the best examples of people wanting to make the world a better place. As cliché as this sounds. No one created open source, people just started doing it. Yet a lot of companies take the work produced by others and try to make money out of it. More than a dozen succeed, but that not a lot of people are even willing to fight it. If someone wants to steal it, no one is going to stop them.

All of the examples from my interactions with others trying to get help and trying to give help are present everywhere. Everyone is trying to balance how much they want to receive to even consider giving out. But ignoring the politics of big open source projects most of them would quite williningly accept any new person. There is not going to be any "we don't have any plugs here" nonsense. That makes the open source space almost like a better version of our society.

But this is all is because I heard an idea once to set up a WiFi network and use the people logging through it to make money. That would be very easy and effective - everyone is constantly looking for a WiFi network in most public places. I can't even imagine ever touching this, there is no price which would make me scam others. You have to draw a moral line somewhere.
