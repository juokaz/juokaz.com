Imagine a company where warehouse shippers need to report issues with the products as they work on them. Things like damaged products, missing units or products not on order. The staff in the front office handles them by calling the manufacturer. In most cases they ask for a replacement or the invoice to be altered. How would you do it?

If you have ever written any code, you can already imagine a thousand ways you could solve this. If you thought of an iPhone app to do this, let me stop you right here - you are insane. Back to reality. For example an interface for a shipper to enter the issue which then gets synced to a business management system. But what if a shipper's job doesn't need a computer? There is no place to access the interface. The simple system now also requires computers installed, logins created and many other things.

For something as simple as reporting issues the costs required would be astronomical. No sane person would ever pursue this. I hope. Instead you print a lot of paper forms for shippers to fill out when problems arise. Exactly the same thing as the planned interface, but costs nothing to operate. The only slow down is the need to enter all the information to the system anyway. One person gets dedicated for that and is happy spending afternoons entering all the issues for the day.

This works for a while. Soon enough though the company grows big enough to have hundreds of these issues a day. While the person entering them can still manage, sometimes the papers get lost. Shippers think the office is working on the issue, while the office assumes everything got shipped fine. At the same time sometimes it takes a few days for the staff to enter a paper issue form and act upon by the staff. Clearly the company has outgrown the process setup. Luckily in the meantime a shipping system has been introduced which required computers. Now the before planned interface can be set up without a huge cost and the only pain point left is the transition period.

Most businesses find themselves in a need of a software solution when they have been doing something for long enough. It becomes impractical to do it by hand or some patterns emerge which could be easy to automate and thus save time. This is the ideal, preferred and the only way to do any software right. By finding that moment in time when it has become clear what the problem is. If you think you can predict that beforehand - good luck, Chuck Norris.

Way too often someone comes up with an idea to do something and then it is the turn of the development team to make it a reality. The problem is that while the idea might seem clear it lacks any real use cases. Any agile practice will make the development quick, but it is still impossible to use it before it is finished. By the time it is, people tend to have already forgotten about it. Once it starts to be used it becomes obvious that a few things don't work that well and thus begins the endless cycle of changes.

Any problem on hand should be analyzed using [impact mapping](http://impactmapping.org/) concepts. My favorite kind of planning supplement. As opposed to _"lets' build a feature to track the people who are late to pay invoices"_ it tries to make everyone think. Why it is important, how it needs to work and who is going to make decisions with it. In most cases, it makes people realize the flaws in their idea. Thus avoiding wasteful development costs.

I find it to be the most effective to always do everything by hand first anyway. Even the things which might look like they are obvious to program. Almost all problems can be solved with a spreadsheet or any other free-form tool. And yet they take no time to develop, cost nothing to maintain and just work. So any idea can be brought to life immediately, by the same people who came up with it or need it for their work. This turns an organization to be much more creative than it used to be. Putting everyone into the problems-solving mode.

A lot of patterns emerge while the staff is using the spreadsheet. How people use it, what data they keep track of, what doesn't work. This makes it easy then to take all that information and start working on an software system. Which in most cases ends up being just a more sophisticated version of the same spreadsheet. If one was used. Yet there was zero time spent trying to come up with fake user stories.

Understanding the [Amdahl's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law) is crucial. It might be challenging trying to optimize every corner of the organization. It is also completely pointless. If just a few or even one person are doing a task and there are no problems with the quality, computerizing it is a waste of time. Introduction of pretty much anything to any company has a base cost so trying to automate all steps might end up slowing it down.

It is crucial to do this in steps, though, by implementing the smallest subset of the required functionality. If you imagined the workflow of a process as a branch of a tree, isolating development for too long might cause a new branch to grow. The role of a development team is observing the company and _fixing_ it piece by piece. Gradual introduction of new tools is both easier to adopt to and safer to install.

What's left then is making sure the automated processes follows what the staff is doing or would like to be doing. As the business grows or changes the workflow changes too. While the application was working fine some time ago, yet again, it is important not to miss when it stops. This requires a constant feedback loop between the development team and the users. Treating them as an outside client won't work.

It is all about timing and prototyping first. Building a software system for a problem which doesn't exist yet is almost always a bad idea.
