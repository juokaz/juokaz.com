title: 427 days of living homeless
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: In July last year I knew that I'll be living in New York as soon as I get a visa issued. So while waiting for that to happen why not spend a few months flying back and forward between USA and... somewhere, I thought. So I did. Instead of waiting for the visa in Edinburgh, where I was living until then, I got rid of everything I owned, packed a bag of clothes and started traveling the world. I regretted making that decision and later was happy having done so probably a thousand times.

If only you can, do this now.

In July last year I <a href="/blog/find-me-in-new-york.html">knew</a> that I'll be living in New York as soon as I get a visa issued. So while waiting for that to happen why not spend a few months flying back and forward between USA and... somewhere, I thought. So I did. Instead of waiting for the visa in Edinburgh, where I was living until then, I got rid of everything I owned, packed a bag of clothes and started traveling the world. I regretted making that decision and later was happy having done so probably a thousand times.

What was supposed to take a couple of months took more than a year - I'm talking about the visa here - but the more time I spent traveling, the less sense it made to stop and get a temporary place until that happens. I continued, for 100'000 miles. Spending days in flights, trains and cars. Sleeping in friends and family houses, hotels and in beds of random strangers. Working from libraries, coffee shops, train stations and cars parked outside of unprotected WiFi networks.

I didn't quit a job to pursue this - I still continued to do what I was doing, just without a fixed place now. More and more people in tech sector are working from home, so I just took this one step further. Apart from having to constantly check timezones and getting used to the question "Where are you now?", there is no difference from working from home or working while traveling. Actually there are quite big communities of freelancers in a few Asian countries, where guys just moved to work from - for the price there is no better life quality anywhere.

However working like this is not easy. It's all about establishing routines, like mine "work every single day", otherwise you'll end up getting nothing done. While I'm lukcy to be in a position to work in my own schedule that doesn't mean that I don't have responsibilities. It's excactly the opposite. But when you travel the chaos of that makes it really hard to focus sometimes, so again it's all about being strict about getting work done, otherwise it will be a stressful vacation with a fired noticed at the end. I found libraries to be the best place to focus and be able to think creatively.

Because I no longer had a car or an apartment, and all the extras which come with those, yet still had a job, financially it wasn't as difficult as one would assume. The only thing to keep an eye on was flights, because getting across in transcontinental flights is hard to do cheaply. Apart from that, living costs are quite similar in most 1st world countries, so there is no difference of renting an apartment and living in Edinburgh or using AirBnB to secure a room in Auckland. As long as your credit cards don't get blocked by automatic anti-fraud systems, then having your own place to come back is an advantage.

Fitting all of your life into one bag is surprisingly easy. I had enough clothes to last almost two weeks, one laptop, one photo camera, two mobile phones, one pair of shoes and that's probably it. I wasn't into collecting things before, but not having any extra space to put things in meant that I just lived with the things I had - I learned to adore a minimalistic lifestyle. I was in Munich in February and at the time it was still pretty cold, but since I was flying straight to Miami I had to get rid of my winter coat. Since buying it I always had it on; it had no space left in the bag.

Legaly I was pretending to be still living and working in UK. I didn't use a mail forwarding service, instead I would just supply my old address, which meant that I was virtually unreachable. I also didn't get a <a href="http://www.worldnomads.com/">worldwide</a> health insurance. Gambling. Fortunataly nothing bad happened, apart from a car rental company trying to reach me by mail for 4 months until they decided to call me. I made sure to have my UK phone still operating, as without that the only way for anyone to get a hold of me would be best to be handled by NSA.

This was one big challenge. That would be lying. It was actually relatively simple. Throughout the time I had conferences and other events planned to attend, so everything else was just filling the gaps. When I was immigrating to New Zealand for some reason I managed to get myself into an in-depth interview of why am I coming to their country. Apparently an honest answer "I'll google what to do here once I get to my rented room" is enough to get you into trouble. Not planning what to do in places and just going with the flow is truly much more enjoyable than marathons of pre-planned checkpoints.

If I was to do this again, I would buy a one-way ticket to Indonesia and take it from there. And don't come back until I'd want this to end. It took a while to *understand* the freedom of being able to be anywhere - even though I had no particular reason to do so, I kept coming back to Europe as if it was some kind of a neutral point. This was a mistake. All these return flight tickets meant that I had to stick to an arbitrary schedule and couldn't spend even a single extra day in places I liked.

Short, planned trips are a horrible way to travel. That never ending cycle of going from an airport to a hotel and back wears you down quickly. For this reason there aren't that many people who enjoy traveling as a job; a few years of this and airports and hotels literally make you sick. Sure it does look fun from the outside, but there is little pleasure in it. That constant stress of the changing conditions eventually becomes tiring. The time spent in Australia and New Zealand is the best memory of this whole stunt. Relaxed Sydney, Formula 1 in Melbourne, exploring the wilderness of the north New Zealand. It was all good, because I went there for 6 weeks, a long enough time to settle in.

I wasn't traveling as a tourist. I don't care too much about visiting places "to see" or taking photos in front of the Eiffel tower. Instead, I traveled to live in places. Trying to blend into the local environment, instead of having a to-do check list of items to do. I attempted to spend as much time as possible with locals, as for me that is the most interesting aspect of traveling. Unfortunately this has one big disadvantage. Even though I've met hundreds of new friends, it is a lifestyle of an outcast. You drop in to a city as if you were deployed there, and then leave leaving others to whatever they've been doing before you came. It is fun to show up in one bar out of three in the whole city somewhere deep in south of France and chat up some locals. However you take off the next day and start this whole thing again. Having to do this over and over again becomes a burden.

Because of this the experience was like riding a roller-coster. I guess, haven't riden one. It varied from being ecstatic to have an apportunity to do this to low points of just being plain tired of not having a *home*. But that's what you get when you are quite literally designing and working on your own lifestyle every day. And it all falls apart when you stop, because there is no one else to take care of it. It's just a skill you develop, because in a lifestyle where every single minute of 24 hours is up to you fully the freedom can be challening to cope with.

Even though this was extremely stressful at times, it was truly a life-changing experience. The more time I spent doing this, the more I started to push for <a href="/blog/why-are-you-so-boring.html">change</a> - life is too short not to fully enjoy it. This was ace.
