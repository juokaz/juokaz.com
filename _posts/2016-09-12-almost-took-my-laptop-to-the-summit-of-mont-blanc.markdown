This was going to be about how I took my laptop to the summit of Mont Blanc and did some work way up there. After [writing code for 1,000 days straight](/blog/i-wrote-code-every-day-for-1000-days.html) it looked like an epic next thing to do.

*Mont Blanc* is the highest mountain in the Alps and in the western Europe. It stands at 4,808 m (15,777 ft) high.

A friend invited me to join this trip to spend two weeks in the French Alps training. We did a lot of glacier walking, climbing vertical walls, getting adjusted to the altitude, etc. all the standard things. Here is a picture of us on the *Mer de Glace* glacier, a place where global warming is more apparent than anywhere else I've been to.

Unfortunately we failed to summit.

We got most of the way there - just 600 vertical meters left. But the last technical bit to climb has proven to be beyond us because of the weather. I'll spare the details, but if you are interested you can reach out to me and I'll walk you through. There a lot more pictures on [my instagram](https://www.instagram.com/juokaz/) too.

Brining my laptop to the top was just a gimmick, since adding a few extra pounds to an already heavy backpack won't make a big difference. Yet it could have made a great story.

We'll try again.
