excerpt: This seems to be the time of the year when everyone is looking back at the things they've done in 2012 and writing down promises for the upcoming year. There are a lot of things I could reflect back on, but I wanted to talk about relationships, friends and traveling. Write down some thoughts which might inspire one of you, and me, to do better next year. It's not like you are going to continue going to the gym after the first week (if you do, read this).

This seems to be the time of the year when everyone is looking back at the things they've done in 2012 and writing down promises for the upcoming year. There are a lot of things I could reflect back on, but I wanted to talk about relationships, friends and traveling. Write down some thoughts which might inspire one of you, and me, to do better next year. It's not like you are going to continue going to the gym after the first week (if you do, read [this](http://archive.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/)).

This year I spent more than 7 months traveling. That's quite a lot. A lot of people would think it's an amazing privilege to be able to do this, and it is to some degree, but at the same time, it's extremely lonely. Of course one ends up meeting a lot of new people and sees a lot of new places, but you are just not connecting with anyone or anything. Not spending much time in one place makes it very hard.

When was the last time you asked someone "how are you doing?". If you are well mannered - the last time you met someone. When did you do the same with someone who you don't see in person very often or at all? Very likely quite a while ago. Most people are horrible at long-distance relationships and thus these are perceived as impossible. Because they are hard and require effort, and people are lazy. Sometimes they just don't know how, too. I think the move "Like Crazy" quite well shows one of the angles also.

And if you are not distance wise close to people, the lazy are not there. You realize this when you start traveling. To start with, I stole this story from my friend; I don't even know who she was talking about, just it made me think. A lot. Since it loosely matches the things I'm doing, I thought it would be a great way to kick this off.

> I just met a man at work. He was born and grew up in New Zealand, later on came to live in London for 5 years, got a UK passport, then he went to work in Hon Kong for 2 years, after that he moved to work in Australia for a 6 years, got Australian passport, and finally USA company offered him a job in New York where he lives at the moment. Currently he is studying at Columbia university business school in NY and because this university has joint program with London School of Economics, he is visiting London every now and then. When I asked him: "Wasn't it difficult to change your living place/life so many times?" He answered: "No. I just wanted to live in New York. So I made this happen".

Brilliant, something I wish more people were doing. Though my biggest worry and the question I got asked the most always was how can you keep changing places you live in and still have... friends. Thus then she asked him about relationships:

> "And how about relationships, friends...?" He answered: "you just put your things into two bags and book tickets. Relationships come and go".

When you pack your things, luckily for me into one bag, relationships don't come and go. They go to die. It is sad, but as far as I can tell for now, most of the relationships are there because it is easy. And a long-distance one is hard. Hard > Easy, thus not worth it. This is the sort of world we live in, especially since Facebook makes it so *easy* to reconnect. Except that it doesn't. It's just a website, it doesn't do anything if you are not doing anything.

I can't not mention Facebook when talking about relationships. I for one think it's a brilliant social tool - the only way I can still be talking to the people I want to be talking - but at the same time, it creates an incredible amount of fakeness. When someones birthday comes, even the people you don't remember talking to in ages resurrect to congratulate you. That's kind of nice, but just about as much as they are willing to invest into connecting with you.

This is very frustrating for me, because I'm never in one place for a long time (>1 month), if at all, and thus the only means of communication I can have with a lot of my friends is through anything else but in person. And when I moved out of Edinburgh I realized how much of the people I talked quite often started to drift off. Relationships come and go, but just because they can only work when both parties are interested in investing into them. Eventually one of them stops caring.

I have a few friends who do reply to my messages, but would never initiate a communication themselves. It looks like an interview. This will go on for as long as I can be bothered. And if I'm not anymore... Boom, gone. That's how much it takes for a relationship to go, because well, one of the parties weren't really willing to do much about it anyway. And that's fine. You might think it's fine, but I don't think it is. I think valuing people you know is worth it, chances are you might regret not working hard on connecting with them later.

I have a few friends who understand this. And that has kept us as friends for a very long time, even given how everyone has moved to different places, lifestyles and lives. For example I met up with one in Prague to stay a few extra days after speaking at the Future of Web Apps there. None of us live in Prague, or in Czech Republic. I happen to be in Prague that week. My friend happen to be bro enough to show up. That's how it works.

I find it strange that so many people can only communicate when in person. This seams to be against all of the tools which were created to extend that: mobile phones, email, social networks, etc. I guess too many assume that a tool does some magic. That's not really the case, you have to use them, you have to show effort to communicate through them. It's not like people don't want to talk, they do, it's just that doing that through a transceiver seems odd. It shouldn't be odd.

It always only takes a single "how are you doing?", don't be shy. Just that people end up waiting for the other end to do that first. And it never happens. So do it more and you'd realize how many people are waiting for that, even though they haven't seen your face in person for a long time. We are in 21st century, thus your village is not where your relationships end.
