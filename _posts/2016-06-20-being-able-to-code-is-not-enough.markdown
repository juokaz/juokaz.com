title: Being able to code is not enough
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: I’m based in New York, a city where developers get paid some of the highest salaries in the world. If I’m going to hire someone here, I want way more than being able to build features. For that, I can outsource to a much cheaper country and get a similar result. Instead, I want to invest into someone who can deliver value with code being just one part of it.

After I gave [some tips how to improve your CV](/blog/why-i-deleted-your-cv), a few responded that developers should not be expected to be able to sell themselves or communicate. Nor should they care about anything but technical skills.

I disagree.

Have you seen the [The IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd)? I’m pushing for the IT staff, all developers and engineers specifically, to not be in the unreachable basement. I don’t want to be in a basement. I don’t want to build companies which have basements. I want people who don’t want that too.

Maybe 5 or 10 years ago a developer only had to know how to code. Today not only does one have to know many different programming languages, devops skills, mobile environments, networking etc., but also ideally be able to share and discuss ideas with others. The job has changed to include many more skills.

As many organizations gave up the top-down approach, where top management come up with *the plan*, engineers are expected to step up and own their piece of the puzzle. Many organizations go a step further and don’t have management altogether, making different teams that much more involved in decision making process.

Yet a lot would say that engineers cannot or shouldn’t be managers. I think they make the best managers. Sure they have to learn the skills of managing and a lot simply don’t want to manage, but having working knowledge of everything programming and being able to build a team is a win. Assuming that managers are a separate group of people is outdated thinking.

The way I see it, the future organizations in engineer-led companies are going to have a lot of engineers across the board.

All of the best engineers I know are also experts in many different areas. All of the best people I know care about many different things. I couldn’t find a quote I was looking for in the [“An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth”](https://www.amazon.com/Astronauts-Guide-Life-Earth-Determination-ebook/dp/B00DTUHIDA) book by Chris Hadfield, but I can remember it talking about how the limitations of the Soyuz capsule size meant the crew all had to be experiments in at least two areas. I find this to be a great analogy.

There is one exception - some people end up becoming experts in a very niche field. They don’t need any of the things I’m talking about. Nonetheless today 90%+ jobs are building “*apps*” (previously known as websites). Since very few organizations have a good track for engineering carrier growth, I would be careful about deciding to be the expert in a certain technology.

Recently Japan decided to teach everyone programming:

> Starting with the primary schools in 2020, computer programming will be made a compulsory subject in the Japanese primary schools. It will be followed by the implementation in middle schools in 2021 and high schools in 2022.

The next generation of professionals are all going to be somewhat sufficient in programming. Soon being able to write code is not going to impress anyone. What is going to be valuable, and is valuable already, is a multidisciplinary skill set.

Engineers should spend just as much time learning *soft skills* as they do programming. From personal skills like management techniques, to industry specifics. This makes one be able to judge and question situations better, figure out better solutions and understand how different projects and companies function.

These can be described as *multiplying skills*, a term I borrowed from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/d1r). For example someone who is good at both engineering and public speaking or writing is miles ahead.

I believe that programmers have the power to create the future. Everyone who argues that they only want to code and all that other stuff is irrelevant.. is frankly going to find themselves irrelevant.
