In February I was back in London to speak at a conference where I got a chance to meet up with my old friend Thijs Feryn. Thijs is a frequent conference speaker as well, and we have been to many countries and even continents together. He is now running his own podcast where he interviews various interesting people from the developer community and I was lucky enough to be one of them.

In the podcast titled [Digital nomad, being homeless & living in New York](https://blog.feryn.eu/juozas-joe-kaziukenas-digital-nomad-being-homeless-living-in-new-york/) we talked about traveling as a way of living and why I'm currently living in New York City. I covered some of that here on this blog as well in [427 days of living homeless](http://juokaz.com/blog/427-days-of-living-homeless.html).

Unfortunately mid-way through recording we realized the camera was not saving any video. So this is the content Thijs managed to put together despite the technical failure. I hope to be back on the podcast sometime in the future.
