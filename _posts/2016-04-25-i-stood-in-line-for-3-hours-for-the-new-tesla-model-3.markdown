title: I stood in line for 3 hours for the new Tesla Model 3
location: Los Angeles, CA, USA
excerpt: At 9am on March 31st across the US and many other countries Tesla stores opened to take reservations for a new car. $1,000 for a ticket to buy one in a few years. I went to one of the west coast stores to check out the scene, and got pretty damn shocked to see close to a thousand people show up.

At 9am on March 31st across the US and many other countries Tesla stores opened to take reservations for a new car. $1,000 for a ticket to buy one in a few years. I went to one of the west coast stores to check out the scene, and got pretty damn shocked to see close to a thousand people show up.

Tesla Model 3 is the first *affordable* and decent electric car on the market. It’s going to cost $35,000 (considerably less than the [ludicrous Model S](/blog/the-ludicrous-tesla.html) you would find on the streets now) and go at least 200 miles on a single charge. It will maybe come out in 2017, but 2018 is likely more realistic as Tesla is yet to ship anything on time.

Yet everyone who wanted to reserve one early haven’t actually seen it. Because it wasn’t even announced then. It didn’t exist. All Tesla did was say “we will show you the car tonight, but if you trust us, you can reserve one in the morning”. [I would trust Elon Musk](/blog/fantastic-future-by-elon-musk.html) to deliver.

So as we stood there for hours I got talking to a few folks and what shocked me the most is how little people knew about the car. Or any car for that matter. They weren’t Tesla-geeks or car enthusiasts. It looked like most of the people were just regular folks who heard about this cool company Tesla and wanted a good electrical car. They didn’t care about the insane speeds the current ones have or the specs of it. They simply wanted a good car.

Studies show that cars are not an exciting product anymore, and every new generation cares less about owning one. Soon enough we will have self-driving cars which are going to make vehicles a commodity tool, not something you would go out and buy. Somehow Tesla just made them exciting again though. A similar car called Chevy Bolt is coming out soon and no one cares. It will likely cost the same and have the same range, yet it has zero excitement surrounding it.

As I’m writing this, the total number of reservations is approaching 400,000. If that number doesn’t sound big, multiply that by the price of the car. Let me help - that’s way over $10 billion. So what Tesla did was the biggest Kickstarter-like launch yet. Or the most spectacular market research experiment ever pulled off.

I haven’t stood in line for an iPhone before so this was a first for me. But a car is not a phone, so standing in a group of people totaling over $3m in sales just in one store alone was quite surreal. I don’t know when was the last time people stood in lines to buy a car in the US.

Everyone who follows Tesla knows about the [The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan](https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me) which goes something like this:

* Build sports car
* Use that money to build an affordable car
* Use that money to build an even more affordable car

This plan was revealed 10 years ago. Well, it worked.

I think this event was a key moment for the car industry and the tech industry as a whole. Hundreds of thousands of people excited about a car built by a startup. If this isn't the definition of disrupting, I don't know what is.
