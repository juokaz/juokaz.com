title: Did you get my email?
location: Vilnius, Lithuania
excerpt: Every time I have to ask someone if they got my email is obviously asking why on earth they haven't replied yet instead. Emailing has become one of the slowest and most unreliable communication channels out there. Everyday there are loads of people complaining about how full their inboxes are and how it will take them hours to get to the bottom of it, because they've spent a weekend offline and it has pilled up to hundreds or thousands of new emails. Are you replying to peoples' prayers?

Every time I have to ask someone if they got my email is obviously asking why on earth they haven't replied yet instead. Emailing has become one of the slowest and most unreliable communication channels out there. Every day there are loads of people complaining about how full their inboxes are and how it will take them hours to get to the bottom of it, because they've spent a weekend offline and it has pilled up to hundreds or thousands of new emails. Are you replying to peoples' prayers?

Who is writing you all these emails? Unless I'm the world's loneliest person, I'd like to assume I receive the same amount of emails as everyone else does. However my inbox is never full. It is actually empty most of the time. That makes things easy - I can check my email on my phone once in a while when traveling or have notifications about new emails while working and respond immediately. That's the whole point of email, I think, and being able to do this makes me more productive.

There are three common lies of the Internet: 1. I Have Read And Agree To The Terms Of Service, 2. Status: Offline, 3. Yes, I'm Over 18 Years Old. I would also throw in this: 4. I Didn't Had Time To Respond To Your Email. Why is this a lie? Because responding to an email, assuming your reply is not an essay, takes a minute or two. Not having time for that is a delusion. Rereading it again when you will have time to respond is going to consume additional time, so if you don't have time now why will you have more time to spend on this later? I'm puzzled.

Email is just another medium for people to pretend to be [busy](/blog/getting-work-done-and-being-busy.html). We seem to be extremely good at turning things we fail at around as an indication of our importance. No, the fact that you can't reply to an email in 2 days is not an indication that you are busy and you have too much email to respond to. It is an indication that you are terrible at email and you don't know where to even start to go through the thousands of emails you get. A day.

All these apps and methodologies which claim to help you deal with email and reward you when you reach inbox zero, like [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/), are just tools to remedy an already horrible situation. It needs to be fixed from a completely different angle. Receiving a lot of emails is not something to be proud of. Not replying to emails fast enough is not a sign of being busy. No apps will help to change this. It is way more important to make it so you never forget pending replies and that you never have to deal with the daily stack of junk.

There is a very tiny link at the bottom of each email: Unsubscribe. And by each email I mean each email you shouldn't be receiving in the first place. All these newsletters, mailing lists and other mass emails are not something you probably want in your inbox. If you think you do, this is the reason you fail at emails already. If you can make it so all the emails you receive are from actual people, have questions for you and you need to look at each of them, you've made your inbox what it was supposed to be.

After replying to an email it goes to an archive. If an email needs no reply it goes to an archive. If you can't respond yet, whatever the reason it is, it stays in the inbox. Three rules to make you great at emails. As long as you do this, your inbox will always contain emails needing your attention now or when you have figured out the answer. Everything waiting for a reply will never get lost just because it took you a month to come up with the answer. Stop arguing, just do this.

As much as asynchronous communication like emails has been promoted to be the preferred way of communication, it is just too slow. Every email I send needs an answer in a minute, because I have that question now and depending on that question a certain decision will be made. Not having that answer means I have to refocus on other things, which is fine, but not ideal. And that's why calling people is so much better. What would take days of emailing becomes a 5 minute call.

Reply time is very important. If it takes you a day to reply to an email there is a pretty high chance that someone is waiting for that and cannot fully continue his work. This is terrible. When it comes to work, feedback loop should be as short as possible - an email should be replied as soon as possible, always, even if you think it is not important (that is not for you to judge). If a developer is working on a feature and he cannot continue unless I reply to an email, I better do it quick.

Quick. Speed is important. Thus most of my replies are very short and extremely to the point, making them look harsh sometimes. Throwing in *"Sent from my iPhone"* at the bottom helps too, some people do that even if they are not sending an email from a device like that - that line makes people accept the short emails better. Mark Twain once said *"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead."*, because explaining oneself in short terms fast is not as easy, so I guess it is a skill to be developed.

The more one waits to reply, the less relevant the reply becomes. I have also noticed that if someone doesn't reply to you quickly more likely than not they are going to take a while to do so, because if one hasn't replied in two days, replying three days later doesn't change much? And if it has been a week with no reply then I don't even expect one anymore and send another email. There is nothing better than forwarding your own emails to the same person. Gets some attention.

It's pretty hilarious that still there are people who believe that a sent email might not arrive and thus are never sure if the receiver has got it. Software pigeons are pretty reliable. I know you got my email.
