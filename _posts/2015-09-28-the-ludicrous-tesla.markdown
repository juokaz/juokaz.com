What happens when you let 762 electric horses loose? It’s immediate and effortless. And practically dead silent. Yet it’s faster than anything I’ve ever touched. You can feel your body fighting the over-1-g pull. It’s surreal.

2\.8 seconds from 0 to 60 mph.

The car I drove pushed the already high $108,000 base price for the P90D to a ludicrous-by-itself $140,000. But the only checkbox which mattered was the $10,000 performance upgrade enabling the Ludicrous mode. Otherwise the pace to 60 mph is a painfully slow 3.1 seconds.

It’s a particularly heavy car, easily exceeding the 5,000 pounds mark (2,250 kg for people using a sane system of measurement) with two passengers inside. But the low center of gravity and the sheer amount of power on tap make the weight disappear. It’s smooth and stable. Throwing it into a corner brings the weight back to mind as the tires start to fight the immense forces. But under normal driving conditions, it drives just fine.

The interior quality falls short though, as it’s still the same as the base $80,000 model. Which, at that price, is not impressive either. It’s not bad looking and the quality looks fine, but it’s rather dull. I recently visited a BMW event for the launch of the new 7 series, price-wise matching the Model S, and it’s easily superior. At least the Tesla has plenty of seating and storage space.

Thus the Tesla is like driving a tank with a rocket engine strapped on top. It’s heavy, and rather unimpressive on the inside, and yet it picks up speed like it doesn’t weigh anything at all.

A big part of its appeal is that it doesn’t look very quick. It doesn’t have racing-inspired front splitters or a rear spoiler, not even an aggressive body kit. It looks like a normal modern car. There is a term used for describing cars like this - a sleeper car. It’s unassuming on the outside, but it can outrun anything on the road. This is appealing to many, since brash, loud, lime-green sports cars are not always welcome.

I doubt many Tesla owners have previously owned cars as fast as this. Heck, there are barely a dozen cars out there as quick as the Tesla. But you don’t hear them spinning into a tree every day. This is because while it is exceptionaly fast, it doesn’t deliver the speed in a savagely manner, but the same way a sleeper car does - as fast as necessary, without shouting about it to everyone else. The sense of having plenty of power on reserve is great.

The speed of it is more accessible than any car out there. For any other fast car you have to mess with traction control or look for launch control. For any manual gearbox car you have to practice for ages until you can time the shifts perfectly. In a Tesla you just press the pedal and it goes. It’s lacking the thrill of why most people buy sports cars. It is too easy. However it’s not trying to be a sports car. It’s a car for normal people which can beat your sports car any day. And for the people who already bought one, that’s all they need.

To achieve this speed, it doesn’t have to make any of the sacrifices most petrol cars have to make. It’s neither stiff and uncomfortable, nor noisy. It delivers as much power as requested. So it can comfortably drive at 10% of its potential and a passenger won’t even know the power it has. But at any moment, pushing the pedal to the floor will make it take off. This makes overtaking a breeze and in general the performance of it very manageable.

But it’s not just the speed. How about the cheap electric power?

I’ve yet to meet a single owner who bought a Tesla because they were trying to save on gas. It’s not a car for that segment yet, the price of the car alone makes the gas price largely irrelevant. But not having to ever come back to a gas station is neat. It has enough range to last for days, and at least in the U.S., even driving across the country is doable. A country where the government practically pays you just so you would buy one. After a few days of it driving, I have yet to understand why some people are worried about running out of charge.

Most current owners bought one because it is different. And arguably *cool*. Any Tesla works as a conversation starter. And will do so for a few years to come. No one *really* cares about the crazy fast Mercedes you just picked up, it’s still a Mercedes and everyone’s cousin has one. The Tesla is rare.

The infamous touchscreen display is hard to miss. The car is completely void of any buttons. Sadly I wish it had at least some, as reaching for the screen and adjusting something while driving is tricky. But that screen has a browser, and for anyone in tech, that means being able to pull up their own apps. Trust me, there is nothing more impressive than demoing your app to a client while driving in one of these. No surprise then that they are ubiquitous on the West Coast.

An aspect that is easy to miss is the fact that the car auto-updates its software over the Internet. Time will show how secure this is, but it is already radically different from any other manufacturer, who rely on complicated procedures done at the dealership to achieve the same thing. And in 2015, the Tesla way is the right way. It’s exactly how I would expect a startup to have solved it.

I’m going to be honest: I find Elon Musk of Tesla amazing. But the car really does deliver on its promise, only 12 years after the founding of the company. I’m still going to be driving fire-breathing classic cars trying to nail a perfect shift, but Tesla is the future. A future in which performance cars will be accessible to everyone.

In the [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvimE0aNFOg) for Forza 4 game Jeremy Clarkson said:

> There’s hardly a place out here for us anymore, not amongst all the commuters and congestion. Not in this growing age of safety and restraint, where practicality trumps adrenalin. Where the ratio of miles to the gallon is championed over horsepower to the weight.

I think Tesla fixes this, because I don’t want to live in a future full of awful Prius hybrids.
