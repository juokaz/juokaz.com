What happens when you let 762 electric horse-power loose? It’s an immediate and effortless feeling. And practically dead silent. Its surreal feeling your body fight the 1-g pull, it’s simply faster than anything I’ve ever touched.

0 to 60 mph in 2\.8 seconds.

The car I drove pushed the already high base price of $108,000 for the P90D to a ludicrous $140,000. But the only checkbox that really mattered was the $10,000 performance upgrade enabling the “Ludicrous” mode. Otherwise 0 to 60 mph is a painfully slow 3.1 seconds.

It’s a particularly heavy car, easily exceeding the 5,000-pound mark (2,250 kg for people using a sane system of measurement) with two passengers inside. But the low center of gravity and the sheer amount of power on tap make the weight disappear. Throwing it around a corner quickly brings the weight back to mind as the tires start to fight the immense forces. It’s smooth and stable and under normal driving conditions, it drives just fine.

The interior quality falls short of the $140k price tag, especially since it’s the same as the $80k base model. Which, at that price, is not impressive either. It’s not bad looking and the quality looks fine, but it’s rather dull. I recently visited a BMW event for the launch of the new 7 series, which matched the model S price-wise, and yet the BMW interior remained superior. At least the Tesla has plenty of seating and storage space.

The infamous touchscreen display is hard to miss, especially because the car is completely void of any buttons. Sadly, I wish it had at least some since reaching for the screen and adjusting something while driving is tricky. But the screen has a browser and for anyone in tech that means being able to pull up their own apps. Trust me, there is nothing more impressive than demo-ing your app with a client while driving in one of these. No surprise then that they are ubiquitous on the West Coast.

An aspect that is easy to miss is the fact that the car auto-updates its software over the Internet. Time will show how secure this is, but it is already radically different from any other manufacturer who rely on complicated procedures done at the dealership to achieve the same thing. And in 2015, the Tesla way is the right way. It’s exactly how I would expect a startup to have solved it.

Simply put, the Tesla drives like a tank with a rocket engine strapped on top. It’s heavy and rather unimpressive on the inside, and yet it picks up speed like it doesn’t weigh anything at all.

A big part of its appeal is that it doesn’t look like it’d be very quick. It doesn’t have racing-inspired front splitters or a rear spoiler, not even an aggressive body kit. It looks like a normal modern car. ‘Sleeper car’ is a term used to describe cars exactly like this, unassuming on the outside but can outrun anything on the road. Many find this appealing since brash, loud, lime-green sports cars are not always welcome.

I doubt many Tesla owners have previously owned cars as fast as this. Heck, there are barely a dozen cars out there as quick is it. But you don’t hear them spinning into a tree every day, because while it is exceptionally fast, it doesn’t deliver the speed in a savage manner. Rather it acts the same way that a sleeper car does - as fast as necessary, without shouting about it to everyone else. The feeling of having plenty of power on reserve is great.

The speed of it is more accessible than any car out there. With no traction control or search for launch control like it’s a bit easier to manage. With any manual car, you have to practice for ages until you can time the shifts perfectly. In a Tesla you just press the pedal and it goes which lacks the thrill of why most people buy sports cars. It is too easy. However, it’s not trying to be a sports car. It’s a car for normal people with the ability to beat your sports car any day. And for the people who already bought one, that’s all they need.

To achieve this speed, it doesn’t have to make any of the sacrifices most petrol cars have to make. It’s neither stiff and uncomfortable, nor noisy. It delivers as much power as requested so it can comfortably drive at 10% of its potential and a passenger won’t even know the power it’s capable of. But at any moment, pushing the pedal to the floor will make overtaking a breeze and general performance very manageable.

But it’s not just the speed. How about the cheap electric power?

I’ve yet to meet a single owner who bought a Tesla because they were trying to save on gas. It’s not a car for that division yet with the price of the car alone making the price of gas largely irrelevant. But not having to ever come back to a gas station is neat. It has enough range to last for days and at least in the U.S., driving across the country is even doable; a country where the government practically pays you just to buy one. After a few days of driving, I have yet to understand why people are worried about running out of charge.

Most current owners bought one because it is different. And arguably cool. Any Tesla works as a conversation starter and will do so for a few years to come. No one really cares about the crazy fast Mercedes you just picked up, it’s still a Mercedes and everyone’s cousin has one. The Tesla is rare.

I’m going to be honest, I find Elon Musk of Tesla amazing. The car really does deliver on its promise only 12 years after the founding of the company. I’m still going to be driving fire-breathing classic cars trying to nail a perfect shift, but Tesla is the future. A future in which performance cars will be accessible to everyone.

In the [intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvimE0aNFOg) for Forza 4 game Jeremy Clarkson said:

> There’s hardly a place out here for us anymore, not amongst all the commuters and congestion. Not in this growing age of safety and restraint, where practicality trumps adrenalin. Where the ratio of miles to the gallon is championed over horsepower to the weight.

I think Tesla fixes this, because I don’t want to live in a future full of awful Prius hybrids.
