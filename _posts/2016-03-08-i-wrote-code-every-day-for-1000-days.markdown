title: I wrote code every day for 1,000 days
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: GitHub, where I store all of my software projects, has this neat feature that shows you how often you push code. For me, it reported 1,000 days on March 5th, 2016. In other words I wrote code every day for the last 1,000 days. Just a few more months and it’ll be 3 years. As you are reading this it might have gone even further.

GitHub, where I store all of my software projects, has this neat feature that shows you how often you push code. For me, it reported 1,000 days on March 5th, 2016. In other words I wrote code every day for the last 1,000 days. Just a few more months and it’ll be 3 years. As you are reading this it might have gone even further.

Important note - every time I talked about this with friends everyone assumed I “worked” every day in the traditional sense of the word. Or that work is all I do. If you really care, [my Instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/juokaz/) gives a much better answer compared to anything I could offer.

My *work* is looking around the world and trying to improve it with technologies (“trying” is a key word here, nothing grandiose has worked yet). Which means, there is a lot of prototyping and trying things out.

This sort of undertaking is a waste of energy unless you are working on your own ideas and projects. The value in it is not the code produced and especially not the amounts of it, but the nature of the daily routine. It’s a meaningless number, but the longer it went on for, the more I wanted to keep it going (that’s the whole idea behind the Jerry Seinfeld’s [Don’t Break the Chain](http://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/) method).

> Seinfeld explained his method for success: each January, he hangs a large year-at-a-glance calendar on his wall and, for every day he wrote new material, he had the exquisite pleasure that can only come from drawing a big red "X" over that day.
>
> Drawing those Xs got to be pretty fun and rewarding, so he kept doing it. Eventually, he began to create a chain of red Xs.
>
> The idea was to never break that chain.
>
> Not only does this approach program the body and mind to sit down and write daily – it also motivates you to continue that beautiful string of big, red Xs. If you don't write one day, you don't get to draw the X.

Unfortunately, even the best ideas, whether it’s a software project or a business, take time to perfect. Instead of investing a lot of effort and then dropping it, I keep digging. The [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) approach to building good ideas is what prevents most of them from ever seeing the light of day. Most people would spend the whole weekend on it, but then never came back around to approach it from a new angle. Spending a bit of time each day, every day, is a much more sane way for both building things and seeing them come to fruition.

Did it hurt? I think burnout happens when one works 100-hour weeks for months, without any clear goal in sight. Sooner or later you just give up. I don’t work a lot nor do I think the western-world obsession with long hours makes sense. Instead I spread it over the whole week. A lot of those days were a quick 15-minute check up in the morning. I don’t know if it makes sense to keep it going, but I haven’t become fatigued yet.

Every week I would find myself having spent all day at meetings or traveling, but always remembering that I need to do that one piece of code to keep the number going. There is a little bit of anxiety associated with it, but it’s more of a mental push to come up with something new to build. Even if it’s a small feature or something experimental. Some of the best and most successful ideas come from those times.

I think motivation is a weak reason to work on things, the real key is hard work. So that’s what this was, a monotonous and obsessive attempt to keep pushing every day. I explored this topic a little bit in my previous article [Comfort kills creativity](/blog/comfort-kills-creativity.html), which got its inspiration from the music artist Jack White. He said that he writes songs when he has a studio booked, not when he was waiting for inspiration. Well that’s what I did as well.

Yet it doesn’t have to be about working on startups. Repetition is a great learning method and there are many people who went from being novices to employable developers for example, by building side projects every day. I didn’t set this as my goal, but yet I look back now and realize the amount of things I learned is endless.
