I used to live in Edinburgh. Actually I lived there for 4 years. Throughout the time spent there I kept getting questions why did I move there and not say London, the obvious (predictable?) choice then moving to UK. It all started with a text message... Something close to "When life gives you lemons, you paint that shit gold" as by Atmosphere.

It was October 2007 when my friend texted me saying:

> I'm applying to study in UK, you should too. Go to [ucas.com](http://www.ucas.com/)

I wasn't really planning to do that, haven't actually even thought about that - I was studying at a pretty terrible school, so it's not like I had much inspiration from fellow students. But my original plan, to study at an university in Lithuania, again all of them not really being up to the standards of anything, wasn't that inspiring either.

So, I thought, why not - what worst that could happen? Opened up the UCAS site, figured out all the required information I would have to supply, wrote a motivational letter, picked 5 universities I would like to apply to (that's maximum allowed limit of places you can apply to) and clicked "Submit". In total it probably took me mere few hours to go from that text message to an actual submission of the application. Which later I would find out took months of preparations for most, not sure why.

I picked Edinburgh as my first choice because it was and still is one of the strongest universities for Computer Science in UK and even Europe, as proved by a lot of ratings and other charts. Furthermore, I knew Edinburgh was a very cool city as I've heard stories about it from my dad who went there couple years before that - it was really the only city in UK I had any sort of emotional attachment to. A nice bonus too was the fact that as an European citizen I didn't had to pay tuition fees at all, so it was more affordable than English universities.

Few months later I had a conditional offer form University of Edinburgh, inviting me to come to study given that I get a 8 out of 10 average during the final year and 9 out of 10 for maths. I had something like 9.5 average and 10 in math, so this all sounded like a piece of cake. And it was, so the next September I found myself landed in Edinburgh and ready to study. But this is not really a story about studying, I'll write about that too one day, this is about that text message.

What fascinates me about it, is that those hundred or so characters were the spark which put me where I am now. If not that... I don't know what would have happened - I'm good at math, but not that good at parallel universe diving - but somehow I'd like to believe that if I was to stay in Lithuania I would be doing way more boring things. I guess mainly because moving to UK literally forced me to step up my game and actually pay attention and put in effort, which I never had to do before.

The lesson which this thought me is that every single small thing has a meaning to life. And you should pay attention to what happens around you, because you never know. Those small opportunities, those small unimportant gestures from your friends might as well just change your life. That's why I like to look back on things, try to connect the dots and I always find some connection. One meeting led to one thing, one tweet led to another, one conference led to another, and at the end you are in a different place than you were only few months before.

I like this quote by Woody Allen - "80 percent of success is just showing up". Which I interpret as meaning that if someone invited you to do something, be it to attend a party, a conference, a date, etc. you better make sure you be there, because believe me when I tell you - chances are, sitting at home is going to create less value. A real life representation of a text message might just happen there, and it only takes, as W. Allen puts, one step - showing up. Nowadays usually meaning closing the laptop, getting off the couch and dressing up.

This applies to not only doing things personally - every small detail of anything tends to have a very big effect in a long run. Like big companies playing around and hacking on things turn into billion dollar business (like Amazon AWS [did](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/11/an-amazon-engineer-had-a-little-idea-that-turned-into-a-billion-dollar-business/265124/)), like ideas which get born as fragile tiny beings so easily ignored (a [belief](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/24/jonathan-ive-on-steve-jobs-and-the-fragility-of-ideas/) of Steve Jobs), like... everything. Small things lead to big things, but so many of those small things just get ignored. 

We didn't go to the same university as my friend did, but we did reconnect probably more than 5 years after that text (keeping in touch with people is not one of my best skills). And it's so cool to see how much has changed in that time - at least for me, practically everything. All because of a simple, unintentional and random text message. I can't tell you how, but don't miss yours.
