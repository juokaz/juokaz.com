title: Getting work done and being busy
location: Via Catognano, Italy
excerpt: Some people assume I shit gold. Probably. Since every day I get people asking me if I work at all or I just do nothing, drive fast cars and travel all the time. That would be totally boring - I actually do have a job and on a normal week I work 80+ hours, plus all the other things (like Whisky Web or conference speaking). I'm not a workaholic, but the things I do make me happy and I work very hard on them. However, I don't like talking about them, thus making it look like they don't exist.

Some people assume I *shit* gold. Probably. Since every day I get people asking me if I work at all or I just do nothing, drive fast cars and travel all the time. That would be totally boring - I actually do have a job and on a normal week I work 80+ hours, plus all the other things (like [Whisky Web](http://whiskyweb.co.uk) or [conference speaking](/conferences)). I'm not a workaholic, but the things I do make me happy and I work very hard on them. However, I don't like talking about them, thus making it look like they don't exist.

Talking about work is very boring, at least I think so, so I avoid this topic as much as possible. Even the question "what do you do?", which previously seemed like a good chance to impress people, is so dull now (as is the trying to impress people). The last time I got asked this, I was a NASA engineer. Just because it's not like people I want to talk to care about this anyway. I really rather people not know what I do, makes things easier.

But you see, the reason you might assume I don't do anything, is because, mainly, I don't complain how busy I am all the time, not just the fact that I don't talk about work much. And the people who do things, you would think, are the ones who are always busy. Such a cute error to make, proving how much reality often differs from perception. People who get things done are efficient, not busy.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are busy all the time - you are doing something wrong. You are either very bad at planning (or someone who is in charge in planning your time), accepting to do more than you can handle or your performance is not what you are expecting. All of them being your problem, most likely, not something someone else has caused it to be. I avoid these, so I can get things done without being always behind, but before looking into that...

I find it irritating and amusing at the same time, how often people would reply to practically everything with "I was busy". As I should feel sorry for you. Well, you are doing things you want to be doing, so the thing you ditched by saying you were busy, is not important enough for you. Say that. You might push it so far, that this will become your excuse to everything.

This is amusing. The fact that people use it as an excuse to not trying to find time to do something. Taking it so far, they convince themselves that the things they actually want to be doing they are not doing only because they have no time left. Which is oh so sad, because you can always find time for doing things you want, at least I can for now. Why do other things then, for money?

Everyone has 24 hours; 8 of them are usually spent sleeping and 8 working. You have 8 more hours left, which everyone chooses how to *waste* differently. Some people spend 4 hours a day commuting (at this rate you might want to build a super-train, it will be cheaper in a long-run), some doing errands they have no interest in. Doesn't really matter what, the point is that most likely 1/3 of the day is up to you, it's only a matter of priorities and control of them what you end up doing.

In most cases when people ask me for things, either to meet or to do something for them, I do that. Because I think people are way more important than a lot of things I might be doing then otherwise. Thus I might seem to be always free, even though I'm really not, I just found your request important enough to do something about it. Most *"busy"* people wouldn't. If only the people I hang out with would do the same as often.

A lot of my friends are young (think unmarried or students). I just deny to believe than majority of them are ever really busy. They can't be. The things they are calling being busy, I would just call being lazy to care. Having spoken to so many of them, I think the set is significant enough to yield that they are just terrible at dealing with time. As a lot of people are, not necessary students. That's how I worked, traveled and studied at the same time - it's all about time planning.

Getting back to work, as mentioned before, time is the only thing money won't ever buy back. Thus I figure out how I can use it effectively and get work done in the chaotic lifestyle I live in. If I have an hour to spare before arriving at the hotel and having a dinner with a friend, I will use it to work or read or for anything else valuable. These gaps of time before doing things are so often discarded as not long enough to even start doing anything. Wrong.

Getting work done is also not necessary as straightforward as you might think. As famously discussed by the 37 signals guys, work not always gets done at work. Almost always it's more effective to hide in some hipster coffee shop, play some tunes on your headphones and work, rather than stay in an office. Luckily I work from an actual office very rarely (although getting more often now), but I still need to figure out how to work while *jet-setting*.

I have a few skills which I trained myself of, allowing me to be very efficient at getting work done. For example, I don't really need a quiet and distraction free office as 37 signals promote, I for one can focus even at the busiest places and the most uncomfortable environments. I have worked from the Paddington train station in London during the rush hour, flying across the Atlantic, after waiting for everyone to go to sleep so everyone would stop bugging me and while being driven in a car. I only need my laptop to get work done, not even an Internet connection, thus I can work from anywhere.

Sometimes this gets quite hard (telecommuting is harder than you might think), but never impossible. I get work done because I can focus on things very well and quickly switch between work and not-work environments in my head. The amount of things I need to potentially do is always greater than I can handle, so I prioritize and delegate them, leaving me with just enough time to afford the lifestyle I want to be living now. And not get stuck in being always busy.

Some people like others to see them as very busy and always doing things. I don't really care about that, you might as well just think that I play all day long. I get work done without complaining how busy I am, because I don't see how is being busy a good thing or in any way an indication of the importance or effectiveness of ones work.
