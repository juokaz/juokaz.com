title: China’s incredible mobile ecommerce growth
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: Alibaba recently reported Q2 2016 earnings - 75% of all merchandise sold was bought by mobile users. This is a huge number. It was barely 7% in 2013. In comparison, only 25-30% of the US online retail sales are done on mobile. When considering all China’s ecommerce platforms including JD.com and others, more than a half of ecommerce sales are made with mobile devices. It is expected that by 2019 that number will rise to at least 70%.

Alibaba which owns Taobao.com and Tmall.com, the who major ecommerce marketplaces in China, recently reported Q2 2016 earnings. Ignoring the strong growth in revenues and gross merchandise sold numbers, the number which attracted my attention is the impact of mobile.

75% of all merchandise sold was bought by mobile users.

This is a huge number. It was barely 7% in 2013. In comparison, only 25-30% of the US online retail sales are done on mobile. When considering all China’s ecommerce platforms including JD.com and others, more than a half of ecommerce sales are made with mobile devices. It is expected that by 2019 that number will rise to at least 70%.

In the last quarter Alibaba had 427 million active users, a 39% increase from a year ago. However that 100 million of new mobile users largely came from their existing user base switching to mobile. So the customers who were already buying from Alibaba websites realized they can do it on mobile and switched. I’m assuming a lot of this was people switching from shared PC’s to having their own personal smartphones.

Furthermore mobile sales generate more revenue for Alibaba - in this quarter the mobile revenue has surpassed desktop revenue. Alibaba does not charge any fees on Taobao.com sales, but instead allows buying ads and other additional services. This makes their revenue per every dollar sold much lower than what Amazon or eBay has (2.5% for Alibaba, 9% for eBay).

In the US most people still access the internet from desktop machines. That’s where most ecommerce happens too because paying by a credit card is annoying on a phone. Even I refuse to buying anything on a phone. This is the reason why mobile ecommerce is growing slowly here - paying on mobile is simply not a pleasant experience and most people would rather not deal with it.

On the other side of the planet, in China more than 30% of internet users only have access to a mobile phone. That’s why most mobile transactions are going through AliPay by Alibaba, WeChat, UnionPay or TenPay. Credit cards are not involved. All of those payment providers are delivering the promise PayPal tried to give, but never managed to reach major use. AliPay alone is already much bigger than PayPal. WeChat which is a chat application, has built social ecommerce right in the platform allowing commerce and payments without leaving the app.

By the way, in India and many SE Asia countries mobile penetration is just as high as China’s. Many people there never had a desktop PC, so once smartphones became cheap enough they jumped from having no access to the internet, to having access to the internet through a smartphone.

I’ve been reading Duncan Clark’s book [Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built](https://www.amazon.com/Alibaba-House-That-Jack-Built/dp/0062413406) recently and while it’s not a great book (I would rate it at 3.5 stars), it tells a lot of interesting stories why business context in China is so different. For example:

> China’s retail market is highly fragmented and inefficient. In the United States, the top three grocery chains account for 37 percent of all sales. In China, they account for just 7 percent. The largest department stores in the United Sates represent 44 percent of total sales in that segment. In China? Just 6 percent.

This meant that ecommerce marketplaces were an obvious solution to most of the retailers’ struggles. Taobao.com, the largest Alibaba’s property, already has close to 10 million sellers on the platform. That’s at least 5 times more than all Amazon marketplaces combined.

Inspired by the book on Alibaba I’ve been researching China’s trends and why things function they way they do. The growth of mobile in ecommerce is a fascinating one because that’s where the US is going to be sooner than later too.
