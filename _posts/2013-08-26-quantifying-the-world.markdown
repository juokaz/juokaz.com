excerpt: Running in a park is a very boring hobby. It is very repetitive, physically demanding and not that rewarding. Thus so many people 'hate running' and don't exercise at all. There is a very easy way to make it exciting - measure your time, distance and speed. Dead easy. The next time you run, aim to beat your best time, best distance or best speed. Or all. In sports, you keep repeating the same task, but with ever-increasing difficulty, speed or distance, and eventually you get very good at it. This not a recommendation, this is the way to do it.

Running in a park is a very boring hobby. It is very repetitive, physically demanding and not that rewarding. Thus so many people "hate running" and don't exercise at all. There is a very easy way to make it exciting - measure your time, distance and speed. Dead easy. The next time you run, aim to beat your best time, best distance or best speed. Or all. In sports, you keep repeating the same task, but with ever-increasing difficulty, speed or distance, and eventually you get very good at it. This not a recommendation, this is *the* way to do it.

Admittedly competing at everything one does is a very manly thing to do. But it is the best way to motivate yourself. Running is not a task you want to check on your daily to-do list just to say that you've done it. Running should be about getting better at it, and never stopping until you reached one of the goals above. Once you reach a point when you can't get better anymore unless you become a semi-professional, you can pick up something else.

I work every day. It doesn't matter if I came back at 7AM in the morning from an eventful night in town or I'm on an international flight. This a simple goal I have. And I track it. Looking at it now, I have worked for 91 days in a row. Of course some days were just a few hours on a Sunday afternoon, but still. Stephen Wolfram has been [doing](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/) this for most of his life. This is enough motivation to make me work as much as I think I should be working. The only reason those streaks would end looks like *C2H6O*.

For the past 3 years or so I have data for every single trip I took, of which were many. Flights, hotels, trains, destinations and dates. It is all stored. This sounds like a completely useless data, but for me, it's gold. For example, I know that last year I spent more than a month out of the whole year traveling just for conferences. It didn't *feel* like I traveled that much, but you can't argue with data. This is my point - people are horrible at interpreting past events and making sense of them; the only way to know for sure is to trust data.

Earlier this year John Broder wrote an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/stalled-on-the-ev-highway.html?pagewanted=all) questioning the Tesla Model S performance after doing an improvised test drive. It got quite some attention. Elon Musk, the guy behind Tesla, thought it was all a lie and replied to it in his own [article](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/most-peculiar-test-drive). This made me very happy. You see, you can't argue with data. And even if it is still unclear who did what wrong, Elon's reply was the only one to back it all up with raw data. None of subjective interpretations.

Nate Silver wrote a book called ["The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail â€” but Some Don't"](http://www.amazon.com/The-Signal-Noise-Many-Predictions/dp/159420411X) last year, which I recommend reading. Not to learn how to predict, as his approach is subjective and has been argued against by many, but for a great list of examples and stories about how predictions in various fields work. If you think weather predictions are a random coin toss, for example, it covers the history of weather predictions quite well. But his book is not why I brought him up. His most famous work was predicting US elections' results. Which were all spot on.

> In the 2012 United States presidential election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, he correctly predicted the winner of all 50 states and the District of Columbia. That same year, Silver's predictions of U.S. Senate races were correct in 31 of 33 states; he predicted Republican victory in North Dakota and Montana, where Democrats won.

Quite an impressive achievement. At the same time, thousands of politicians, journalists and various over voodoo artists offered their own view on who is going to win and by how much. All they did was guess. Guess by extrapolating from nothing. Nate Silver, which later got accused of all sorts of different things by the same voodoo artists, showed that when it comes to predictions, the only way to do it right was to use data. There is just no way a single human can answer these sort of questions without just pure guessing.

Nowadays it is all about the data. Forget the *big data* hype, the sheer size of a data set doesn't influence the quality of the results that much. What everyone is working on is finding new data sources and ways to combine them to make sense. We've been using data to make decisions for quite a long time, but now the costs of storing and processing data have become so small that they no longer matter. Thus market leaders have moved on from old-style business intelligence to doing data science. Which is all about finding and using data to make new decisions.

Researchers at MIT have been [sucessful](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/predicting-twitter-trending-topics-1101.html) at predicting what topics are going to be trending on Twitter before they... do. Two weeks ago Apple stocks soared to a six-month high and boosted the company's market value by $US12 billion to $US444.8 billion, following two tweets from 77-year-old US billionaire investor Carl Icahn. Now imagine you had that MIT technology running to help you with stock trading. Today social networks are one of the metrics to look at when evaluating stock prices as they have an ever-growing influence which, differently from anything else, can change extremely quickly.

Social networks are eating away billions of hours from peoples' lives every month. I guess. Most likely only 10% or so is the time people are aware of that they are wasting, everything else is those "let me check Facebook quickly" not-so-quick breaks. To fight that, I have installed a few extensions for my browser to track every single website I go to, categorize them and tell me where I'm spending the most time at. The results were mostly expected, but some shocked. One month I spent 10 hours browsing [dailymail.co.uk](http://www.dailymail.co.uk). Quite ashamed of this.

I've done some experimenting with [sleeping](blog/you-can-sleep-when-youre-dead.html). Wait a moment. I seem to be doing way too many experiments with myself. Anyway. There are neat tools to track your sleep time, quality and length. I tried most of them. For months I have been tracking every night of sleep. Eventually I figured ways to improve my sleep and it worked. Every person I know who says they are sleeping for 5 hours a day is doing at least 7, but have never looked at that. I did.

If I couldn't measure how well I'm running I would probably still be terrible at it. However I can, as I can measure pretty much every single aspect of myself. It takes some time and initial investment, but taking the example from sports, it is the only and proven way to get better. And I'm all about getting better at everything I do. But it doesn't stop at just personal metrics, everything nowadays depends on metrics. From simple web applications to big corporations are getting measured every second to be able to tell what is going to happen next.

This is very exciting, albeit geeky. I was reading Marissa Mayer's [biography](http://www.businessinsider.com.au/marissa-mayer-biography-2013-8) last night and one quote stuck with me - "It's not what Zune knows, it's how Zune thinks" (read it for this to make sense). This is exactly how everything works today. It's not about the knowledge base, it's about being able to ask the right questions and understand newly presented facts, data. To be better.
