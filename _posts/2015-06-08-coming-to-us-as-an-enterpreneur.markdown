title: Coming to US as an Entrepreneur
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: In September 2013 I moved to US after having spent months waiting for a work visa to be done. The problem with a work visa, officially known as H1-B, is that it ties you to the petitioning company. Not only you would lose the right to stay in the country were you to get fired. But also as far as the US government is concerned, that’s all you are here for. Which means no other work engagements are allowed, starting your own company being one of them.

In September 2013 I [moved](/blog/427-days-of-living-homeless.html) to US after having spent months waiting for a work visa to be done. The problem with a work visa, officially known as *H1-B*, is that it ties you to the petitioning company. Not only you would lose the right to stay in the country were you to get fired. But also as far as the US government is concerned, that’s all you are here for. Which means no other work engagements are allowed, starting your own company being one of them.

Which is exactly what I was going to do. One thing I was not supposed to do.

That’s not actually strictly true. You *are* allowed to start a company, but you just can’t work for it. While a work visa can be transferred to any other company, the new startup won’t work.  Part of the process of getting a work visa is showing the urgent need for the company to have you and not someone else. While the company you just started definitely needs you, the government would argue otherwise.

I was left with an option to move back to Europe where I can do anything I want, or continue to be in US with the limiting work visa. I found an immigration lawyer instead and went to see him. The conversation went something like this, and I could only assume it’s fairly similar for most:

> Lawyer: Hello. <br />
> Me: Hi. <br />
> Lawyer: So, you are trying to stay in the US. Are you married? <br />
> Me: No, not yet. <br />
> Lawyer: Are you planning to get married anytime soon? <br />
> Me: I don’t think I am, no. <br />
> Lawyer: Well… let’s look at other options then. <br />
> *\*the conversation then continues for an hour*\*

Luckily we did find an alternative. We decided to try to apply for the *O-1* visa. By we I mean I sat there and nodded. Which takes proving to the immigration office that you are one hell of an worthy person, officially known as an *extraordinary alien*. But in return it does open up your arms when it comes to work.

All it takes to finish an application is documenting every past work experience, open-source too, public appearances and getting recommendation letters from colleagues. Or simply having won a Nobel prize would do. My work visa application from a few years back was 30 pages long, this time though it was over 300 pages. All of which were prepared by the law office, it’s not something I could have winged.

At some point in time the current work visa ended, but the new application hasn’t been finished yet. So I took a one way flight  out of the country hoping to come back soon enough. This was hugely optimistic as the only reason I thought I was coming back was because a guy in a suit told so. Everyone asked “What are you going to do if the visa is not approved?”. I didn’t know.

Then the application got filed and approved, and I was on a first flight back.

There are many stories of eager entrepreneurs trying to come to US and failing. And then doing amazing things somewhere else like the [Snapdeal story](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/americas-unwanted-ivy-leaguers-flocking-210634992.html). I hope changes in immigration law are going to happen sooner than later and we won’t have to invest so much effort into being here.

P.S.
If you are looking for ways to come to US I would most certainly consult with an immigration lawyer. Options change depending on ones country of birth, work experience and other factors.
