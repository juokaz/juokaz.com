title: Online privacy hypocrites

excerpt: Privacy online is a never-ending discussions' topic, especially with services like Facebook becoming a huge part of one's life. However, the issue is not the privacy itself, but what people want to do with it.

I'm always puzzled when people complain about the lack of privacy online. May I ask, who is forcing you to share the things you don't want to be public online? No one is. I look at this from this perspective: once you share something it's like you tell your secret to someone - it's *not* a secret anymore. Privacy settings in all of those services just add a layer of perceived privacy, but in a nutshell you are still sharing things with a really hard to control list of people and expect them to respect the privacy - and do not argue that you can control that.

For example let's say you share something private with a group of 5 people. The only way it stays private, is if those people do not re-share it to a bigger network. But you can't know that for sure. It does protect you from a random person finding that information by themselves, I'll give you that, but it still doesn't give you full privacy. It takes a lot of work and being careful, and let's be honest in most cases not being drunk too, to actually handle what gets shared and how well.

Facebook has famously played with privacy controls over the years, but I think the current is more than decent. What Google Plus offers is theoretically better, allowing to share information with a selective list of people easier, but it's too much work - for example I don't have any interest in managing them, because with a pretty long contacts list, it becomes hard and time consuming. And not something I want to spend any time on. I solve this by not sharing anything anywhere what I would consider to be risky, and all my problems disappear. At least I would think so, but you'll see later why that's not always the case.

Not sure what sort of friends people discussing online privacy have, but a huge portion of the ones I have share stuff marked as public on Facebook. And then we meet in real life and argue about online privacy. This is just ridiculous. But that's the trend I see - people don't really pay too much attention when it comes to privacy, but expect some sort of magical force to control all of this. For example I don't upload my half naked shots in front a bathroom mirror, thus I don't have to worry about that at all. Actually you would do a lot of good by not doing that anyway.

But that's not the issue I want to talk about, what I want to talk about is the fact that people actually want others to be somewhat not strictly private, allowing them to figure things out when they want to, while hiding their own stories. That's natural human behavior and I wouldn't expect it to be any different - I just think that people discussing privacy should keep this in mind. To prove this let me briefly tell you a story about a girl I met a few months.

So I met this girl, let's call her Jenny, a few months ago, while going out with a friend to visit some local pubs in Edinburgh. We had some things planned the next morning so we had to call it a night quite early, thus we ended up exchanging numbers, as you do. Coincidentally my name is quite hard for most of the population to handle and I always go by Joe, but when the time comes to enter my name to the contacts list, I end up having to make up a surname... this time it was The Pirate. Joe The Pirate.

My age still puts me in a category of people who text each other, so that's what we did for the next few days. Of course eventually the question comes up about what my surname would actually be, even if calling myself a pirate had a lot of context, albeit not very important for this story. Pretty cool though that so many people actually buy that my name is Joe. Getting back to the point, sooner or later that question comes up and my actual name gets revealed - not that it is a secret.


What we end up discussing next is the fact that my name, and the fact that I'm pretty active in the internetz, means that one can find a lot of stuff about me online. On the other hand, Jenny is a very common name, thus creating some sort of privacy as finding anything online would be pretty much impossible. Furthermore, she wasn't using Facebook too, mainly because of the lack of privacy and the amount of fakeness around all interactions there, all of which I totally agree with, but just bear with me a second.

After going back and forward about various issues with privacy online and all sorts of other things, she comes back with this, seemingly after Googling my name and checking out all the things available online, and I quote:

> Good luck with all your traveling! I'm sure you'll do well. And your girlfriend is very pretty! 
> The advantages of the Internet. :) nice to have said hello!

No comments here, apart from resemblance to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh0AhrY9GjA&feature=plcp) and the fact that it's weird and wrong and definitely not the sort of stuff I want to be dealing with. Funny story though, I have a lot more of them coming, so keep this link. I don't think people want privacy, at least not for others' stuff.
