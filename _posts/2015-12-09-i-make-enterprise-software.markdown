Everyday I listen to someone explain how they need *"real"* software for their business, not an online app that is just a toy. This is exactly why those toys are overtaking the enterprise market.

My friend's business had a lot of people sharing files over email and network attached drives. It was a major annoyance, so it was time to move to this new thing they saw on TV, the "cloud." They wanted something a bit more enterprise-grade though, so they decided to set up a [hybrid system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Hybrid_cloud). Well, by the time that got rolled out, employees had realized that there are tools like [Box](https://www.box.com/) that are ready to be used here and now. So they were left with a fancy storage system which no one uses versus a $5/month app used by everyone.

There are plenty of companies offering cloud storage tailored specifically for enterprises. And all this over-complication does is offer a worse experience than Box or Dropbox, costs more, and takes months to roll out.

Is it more secure, reliable and controllable? Yes. Do you work for Bank of America? No. So none of this probably matters.

There is a massive industry built around helping companies manage their IT infrastructure and these are the people that would argue that all of this is still relevant today. I refuse to believe that. I can't see it as anything more than an entangled mess which prevents businesses from being flexible. And the people suggesting that most online applications are not enterprise-ready enough are fighting a battle already lost. But there is a way to get around the old mindset.

Box is probably my favorite example of how to sell and market software right. At least initially, instead of having a sales team go and try to sign up big corporations, they built a product which anyone could setup. And if they liked it, it could then be introduced to their team. Next thing you know it's being utilized by the entire company. Slack did exactly the same thing. People first started chatting about it within their own teams, but once others in the company heard about it, they wanted to be a part of it, too.

Contrast that with the way most IT was done 10 years ago. You were given a PC for work and every single application on it would be controlled from a central location. So if you decided you wanted to try something out, you would have to submit a request to someone higher up... which in reality meant it was never going to happen. Here is the sad part - this wasn't just 10 years ago, it still happens all the time today. Most of the IT practices were built at the time when most people hadn't even seen a PC before, which is obviously obsolete today. Today, the idea of restricting employee's computing capabilities is out of touch with any current enterprise.

These restrictions were set up when barely anyone knew what a computer was. Entrusting them with anything more than basics meant disasters like deleted company files. Today though everyone has a smartphone. They come expecting the same access to software as they have on their phone.

That's why for startups it was so *"easy"* to disrupt existing tools. From messaging to file sharing, from email to payroll, the existing structure was there, but it was complicated and expensive. Instead focused apps got built and the problems went away. For any industry that acted as if they would only work with big apps, startups spread like wildfire and got in through their employees, leaving management no choice but to adopt the startup app. It's hard to argue that you would only ever use an enterprise cloud system, while all of your staff is happy using Dropbox.

What is enterprise IT today? It isn't dying, but changing and adapting as the amount of companies who need help are decreasing. Most are jumping on services available online, for them even the word enterprise is largely irrelevant. There are no licenses to manage or connect them to the Windows domain. Whatever that means.

"Nobody ever got fired for choosing IBM," a phrase which suggests choosing a more established option for no other reason than that it is more conventional. This used to work but this sort of traditional thinking made [HealthCare.gov](http://www.wired.com/2014/08/healthcare-gov) one of the most spectacular technology failures in the recent history. It was a software project destined for failure even though it was developed using a trusted pattern from the past for "real applications." After the failure to launch, a team got hired to fix it and it was back up in no time. But this time it actually worked yet cost 95% less to run. And it no longer involved dozens of consultants and contractors.

In a conversation with my accountant recently we were discussing the differences between Quickbooks online and desktop versions. [Quickbooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBooks) is an accounting application so there is a constant need for internal access and also by external bookkeepers or CPAs. The online one is still lacking... but heck the desktop Quickbooks has been around since the early 90's so of course it will take time to catch up. Although, it has a major flaw - there is no way to access it remotely. So how do people get around that? By sharing the Quickbooks database file using a flash drive, entertaining, right? Hell no!

A fundamental part of any business software today is to be accessible by everyone, even outside the office. This is commonly achieved by having an online application, as making old giants like Quickbooks sharable is practically impossible. As more people realize the importance of this, convincing anyone that enterprise software nowadays is just an online app won't be needed.
