I like to build things - I build two to five startups a year. Most of them never see the light of day, because prototypes fail to deliver or I realize that the market won't accept it. Through that I get to learn various different lessons, however this one is quite special.

A few years ago cloud was the race everyone was trying to win. Ignoring the big players Microsoft and Amazon, smaller startups like Heroku or EngineYard were gaining momentum by abstracting away the complexity of big cloud providers and providing with something quick and easy to use. There wasn't a project like that running on [Azure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Azure), Microsoft's cloud, and it being one of the most overcomplicated systems, I thought maybe I should fix this.

I developed a prototype project called *Azure+*, a name which was a golden ticket to a cease and desist, which was taking the existing Azure infrastructure and abstracting away all of its complexity. Currently there are loads of open-source projects providing ways to build infrastructures like this, at that time I brainstormed how it all should work. I spent enough time messing with Windows systems to know how to make various of its components behave like I needed to.

I used to work with Microsoft on a few different projects and had made a lot of connections in there. So as soon as I built the prototype, I emailed them all and invited to a demo call. I didn't look at Microsoft as a competitor, so it looked sensible to show that to them first. These were really fun. It used to be me and 5 or more Microsoft guys and I would use Skype to show around the application. For two weeks in a row I would give demos and gain feedback how to improve it further.

One of the functionalities of the system is that as soon as you would create a container for an application it would also create a database for you. The problem though, Azure had no way to automate that easily. One had to open up their management portal and add an instance by clicking a button. Guess what was happening then the loader icon was spinning? I would open that management portal and do that by hand. No one was using the application when they weren't on a call with me so this was very easy to do.

Eventually I got invited to a Microsoft event in Microsoft HQ in Redmond. It was a small group event for some of Microsoft partners so they could show off the new stuff they are working on so we could give some feedback before it hits public release. I just gave a keynote in a conference in Barcelona about cloud tools, where I sneaked in a short demo of Azure+, and I was sitting on a plane towards Seattle thinking something great is going to happen. I was ecstatic, going there to talk all of these Microsoft people in one room and show what I had.

The first thing they showed on the first day, which I almost missed because I managed to get lost in their endless and illogical [campus](http://campusbuilding.com/microsoft-campus-map-picture/), was what is now known as Azure Web Sites. The exact same system I built two months earlier. That was quite a disappointment. Obviously the first thought I had was why no one have told me they had this in works. I talked to 25 or so Microsoft employees, starting from developers and evangelists, and ending with senior VPs, all of them knew this, but didn't let me know.

I felt cheated. For a while. Microsoft, or any big company, doesn't share their plans until they are final products released to public. Otherwise a competitor would have more time to react. Even though I was a tiny fish to them, they still couldn't risk me leaking that they are building all these new projects, so instead they led me to nowhere. And while I thought I was getting feedback about my own system, they were listening to what I built and how, to make sure they do better. At least I got a chance to go to that event and see them, otherwise I would have wasted half a year pushing my own project forward. All to end abruptly.

Even though this idea ended up failing and there is a lot of things I do differently now, there are a few things I did right. It is crucial to build prototypes. What I was showing to everyone was one big hack. However, the interface was smooth and fluent, so no one could tell that. The list of features to add was huge, but none of them were really important so I didn't. Focusing on the core features was both easier and faster, replacing hard to implement features with hacks was good enough.

Azure+ name wasn't chosen by accident, it was a codename to get attention. The blog post introducing it was read by over 25'000 people in less than a week, in a lot of cases because people assumed it was something Microsoft has released or some was trolling Microsoft. Microsoft people themselves have found this through their own means and then came to me asking to talk more. Inside people later told me it was being talked about by everyone at Microsoft. It was a brash hustle and it worked.

Only two weeks passed since I started working on it when I was giving the first demo. Early validation from the people who know is very important. In the end, two months after starting this I sat in the demo of Microsoft's own go at this and realized that the project hit a dead end. Even though it then took them almost a year to release the final product, I knew that beating them at something built on their own platform was insane. The chance to make it big was so slim and the required investment was big enough that it just wasn't worth it.

I was roughly six months too late to make this happen. I had the idea for more than a year before I actually started working on it, and was I to actually do it, chances are it would have been acquired by Microsoft and I would have walked away successful. I was having lunch with a guy who was running this whole project and I'm almost certain that he was a bit confused why his team of 40 people were not really a head of a one-man side project. But once a company like Microsoft commits to doing it themselves, they are not going to stop.

A lot of people assume I hate Microsoft since then. I don't. The fact that we both built the same system means I was right in my thinking, just a bit too late. But the way I approached this was the only way to do it - build something quick, make everyone notice it and see how they react. Two months from an idea to a close down of the project is perfect for a startup. They did want me to work for them after all, but I'm glad I didn't give in, I haven't seen anything exciting built by those teams since then.
