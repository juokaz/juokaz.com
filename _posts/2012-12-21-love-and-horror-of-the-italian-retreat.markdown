title: Love and horror of the Italian retreat
location: Vilnius, Lithuania
excerpt: When I started living homeless, almost 4 months ago, I had a few ideas how to make the whole stunt more exciting. One of them was to get a group of friends and ship them to some remote place in say Italy just to live for a while. So in November I created an event on Facebook called "Italian retreat", invited some people who I thought would go for this, and started planning. Most of the Europe would be pretty cold then, so why not just go somewhere warm and do something different for a change?

As long as you can take care of a flight, which is pretty easy to do flying in into Milan, you just need to come - the place is going to be reachable from Milan airports.

When I [started](/blog/living-homeless) living homeless, almost 4 months ago, I had a few ideas how to make the whole stunt more exciting. One of them was to get a group of friends and ship them to some remote place in say Italy just to live for a while. So in November I created an event on Facebook called "Italian retreat", invited some people who I thought would go for this, and started planning. Most of the Europe would be pretty cold then, so why not just go somewhere warm and do something different for a change?

So from December 4th till 20th we were living in a 16th century stone house in the [Cattognano](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=Via+Catognano,+Cattognano,+Massa-Carrara,+Italy&hl=en&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=9.363881,26.477051&oq=via+catognano+&hnear=Via+Catognano,+Cattognano,+Massa-carrara,+Toscana,+Italy&t=m&z=16) village, us and the 8 official residents of the whole village. And a cat. Luckily nowadays [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) is the only thing you need to get a place like this, nonetheless it took quite a long time to find exactly what I was looking for. What a lot of event organizers don't realize, especially when organizing a conference (all the USA conferences I've been to were just horrible in this regard), is how important the surroundings are. And I think it's one of the few key elements.

And that's why for the second edition of [Whisky Web](http://whiskyweb.co.uk/) we spent a ton of time researching and scouting every possible venue in Scotland - because it matters way more than you'd think. A venue creates a theme and sets an emotion, it's not just a place to put people into. Thus you'll be having a very different time if an event is happening in a ancient castle or a Hilton hotel. None of those being worse than the other, just a different thing. Thus for this trip I was looking again endlessly for the right place.

It had to be something *different*, preferably in a middle of nowhere and very spacious. The place I ended up getting for example had no proper heating, only 4 wood stoves heating the house by heating the air surrounding them - likely the most inefficient way to do it. But that was brilliant, because combined with the fact that everything look very old and Italian, it just made sense. Wearing coats inside probably wasn't the most practical thing, but getting just a house, with normal heating, modern furniture, etc., would be just living the same life as a week before, just in Italy. And this was supposed to be epic.

Oh my fucking god epic it was. I probably have used up all my good karma points this year, because I managed to get everything to go horribly wrong. For example once we had iOS Maps to lead us to a dead-stuck situation in the mountains, with both the way forward and back too steep and too slippery to drive. Then a week later I decided to show the place we had this accident to my brother and driving back we crashed the car because of the breaks failure. Achievement unlocked.

Both times resulting in asking locals for help, hours on a call with Hertz emergency services, sleeping in random hotels to spend the nights, walking for miles to not freeze to death, etc. We still have this to resolve with Hertz, because they are claiming it was my fault and want me to pay for the damages. Which is not going to happen. But oh well, we lived at least. Others had a tire explosion, 100 EUR bill eated by a toll machine, credit cards getting frozen for anti-fraud reasons, flights canceled or rerouted, and more. And this was the best thing which could have happened.

You see, moments like this are what make trips like this epic. Going to Rome for a week, walking all days to look at the historical monuments and eating a pizza at some place, is going to be a trip you are not going to remember after a month. I'm pretty sure me and likely everyone else will remember this for the rest of their lives. Because we lived through this chaos and stress together; it might seem like a big deal to crash a car (given you don't suffer injuries), but a second later you are on a path to make things right again. Not crying for a week how dangerous it was and how all of you could have died. You didn't, make it a memory.

Getting past the horrible moments we had, it was filled with joy too. Italy obviously wasn't as warm as it is during the summer, captain obvious right here, but it was mainly sunny, warm and refreshing. Driving in the mountains north of the place we lived was spectacular (and stomach-upsetting to everyone in my car, sorry), visiting places like [Portovenere](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=portovenere&hl=en&sll=44.335636,10.103302&sspn=0.369818,0.827408&hnear=Porto+Venere,+Province+of+La+Spezia,+Liguria,+Italy&t=m&z=13) was unexpectedly beautiful, eating Italian food was, obviously, delicious, and drinking liters of supposedly-awesome local wine was... very fun.

I feel very lucky to have 10 friends who did came. There was at least 10 more who were supposed to come, but couldn't because of various complications. To be honest I thought no one would come, because I thought it wasn't going to be inviting to a lot of my friends, but hey, I was wrong. I guess it also has to do with trust - people who know me trusted me enough to buy their flights and expect something when landed. If not the people, nothing would have been as good as it was, so cheers to the ones who partake in this experience.

I'm going to be organizing something like this again, and you are probably invited. It might be Italy again, because I learned that Hertz [rents](http://www.insideline.com/lotus/evora/rent-a-lotus-evora-from-hertz-europe.html) Lotus Evora's, and given how great the roads in Italy are for cars like this, it should be pretty... stomach-upsetting, again. It might somewhere else, though. It was a somewhat expensive, but a very fulfilling endeavor to pursue, and I sure hope I'll find people to do something like this again. It was indeed epic (albeit different kind of epic than most expected). As promised.
