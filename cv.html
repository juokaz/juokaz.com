<h2>Startups</h2>

<p>
    I have worked on many different online projects and have built a few successful startups before. Having tried many more failed prototypes, I’m focused on prototyping and shipping products fast. Growth is the most exciting part of the work, so I tend to manage technology and strategy.

<img src="/images/stocklevel.png" alt='StockLevel' class="logo" />
<h3>StockLevel B2B<span>2015</span></h3>
<p>Private wholesale marketplace. The goal was to automate and standardize information exchange between manufacturers and retailers. It helps manufacturers manage all the retailers they sell to, and allows retailers to buy more effectively, as if buying from Amazon.com. Ultimately, it removes endless phone calls, email threads and fax messages. Failed to gain traction after the sales team talked to hundreds of manufacturers.</p>

<img src="/images/conferencus.png" alt='Conferencus' class="logo" />
<h3><a href="http://juokaz.github.io/conferencus.com">Conferencus</a><span>2014</span></h3>
<p>Conferences' material, like slides and video, sharing platform. Similar to SlideShare and SpeakerDeck, but with many improvements. Gained some traction, but could not foresee a business model as all the content was user generated and hard to monetize. Decided to shut it down as free-content platforms are not sustainable in a long run.</p>

<img src="/images/azureplus.png" alt='Azure+' class="logo" />
<h3>Azure+<span>2011</span></h3>
<p>A PHP application hosting platform built on top of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. The goal was to make hosting applications on Azure much easier, by removing all the complexity Azure had at the time. Built a prototype, pitched and demoed to PHP developers and Microsoft staff. Ended up shutting it down after learning that Microsoft is building a competing product.</p>

<p>Competition tracking and analysis tool for ecommerce retailers. Collects products' historical price and supply information in any number of competing stores. Helps with pricing strategies and buying. Was too difficult to scale to work for everyone, decided to close it and instead use it for private cases.</p>
