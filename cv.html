<h2>Startups</h2>

<p>
    I have worked on many different online projects and have built a few successful <a href="#startups">startups</a> before. Having tried many more failed prototypes, I’m focused on prototyping and shipping products fast. Growth is the most exciting part of the work, so I tend to manage technology and strategy.

<h3><a href="http://www.stocklevel.com/">StockLevel.com</a><span>2015 - continuing</span></h3>
<p>Focusing on the manufacturing side of ecommerce, by building tools to make communication and data sharing between manufacturers and retailers easier. Outcome is still developing.</p>

<h3><a href="http://juokaz.github.io/conferencus.com">Conferencus.com</a><span>2014</span></h3>
<p>Conferences material, like slides and video, sharing platform. Similar to SlideShare and SpeakerDeck. Gained some traction, but could not foresee a business model for this to work, as all the content was user generated and hard to monetize. Decided to <a href="https://github.com/juokaz/conferencus.com">open source it</a> as free-content platforms are not sustainable in a long run.</p>

<p>Co-founded a ~150 people, two-day conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. Focused on web technology topics and recreational, traditional activities. Worked on sponsorships, planning, speaker selection and financials. After leaving Edinburgh it was not continued for the third year.</p>

<img src="/images/azureplus.png" alt='Azure+' class="left" />
<h3>Azure+.com<span>2011</span></h3>
<p>A PHP application hosting platform built on top of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastucture. Similar to Heroku, but for PHP which was not getting supported by most of the platforms at the time. Built a prototype, pitched and demoed to PHP developers and Microsoft staff. Ended up closing and <a href="https://github.com/juokaz/azureplus">open sourcing it</a> after learning that Microsoft is building a competing product.</p>

<p>Competition tracking and analysis tool for ecommerce retailers. Collects and stores products pricing information in any number of competing stores to help with pricing strategies and buying.
