<h2>Startups</h2>

<p>
    I have worked on many different online projects and have built a few successful startups before. Having tried many more failed prototypes, I’m focused on prototyping and shipping products fast. Growth is the most exciting part of the work, so I tend to manage technology and strategy.

<img src="/images/stocklevel.png" alt='StockLevel' class="logo grayscale" />
<h3><a href="http://www.stocklevel.com/">StockLevel</a><span>2015 - continuing</span></h3>
<p>Private wholesale marketplace. Helps manufacturers manage all the retailers they sell to. Allows retailers to buy more effectively, as if buying from Amazon.com. Yet still provides tools for data sharing, integration with other systems and forecasting. Outcome is still developing.</p>

<img src="/images/conferencus.png" alt='Conferencus' class="logo grayscale" />
<h3><a href="http://juokaz.github.io/conferencus.com">Conferencus</a><span>2014</span></h3>
<p>Conferences material, like slides and video, sharing platform. Similar to SlideShare and SpeakerDeck. Gained some traction, but could not foresee a business model, as all the content was user generated and hard to monetize. Decided to <a href="https://github.com/juokaz/conferencus.com">open source it</a> as free-content platforms are not sustainable in a long run.</p>

<img src="/images/whiskyweb.png" alt='Whisky Web' class="logo grayscale" />
<h3><a href="http://www.whiskyweb.co.uk/">Whisky Web</a><span>2012-2013</span></h3>
<p>Co-founded a ~150 people, two-day conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. Focused on web technology topics and recreational, traditional activities. Worked on sponsorships, planning, speaker selection and financials. After leaving Edinburgh it was not continued for the third year.</p>

<img src="/images/azureplus.png" alt='Azure+' class="logo grayscale" />
<h3>Azure+<span>2011</span></h3>
<p>A PHP application hosting platform built on top of Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. Similar to Heroku, but for PHP which was not getting supported by most of the platforms at the time. Built a prototype, pitched and demoed to PHP developers and Microsoft staff. Ended up closing and <a href="https://github.com/juokaz/azureplus">open sourcing it</a> after learning that Microsoft is building a competing product.</p>

<h3><a href="http://juokaz.github.io/sellerscout">SellerScout</a><span>2011</span></h3>
<p>Competition tracking and analysis tool for ecommerce retailers. Collects products' historical price and supply information in any number of competing stores. Helps with pricing strategies and buying. Was too difficult to scale to work for everyone, decided to close it and instead use it for private cases.</p>

<p>A team of 5 we built one of the first ecommerce books stores in Lithuania. I focused on the technology stack. We built an in house storefront, warehouse management and other software. It's still going to this date, I left after the company raised an investment round and I wanted to focus on other things.</p>

<h2>Thought Leader / Speaking</h2>

<p>I'm passionate about using technology to provide simple answers to complex problems. I have been an advocate of data science and building data-driven processes for a long time.</p>
