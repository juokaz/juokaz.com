9 months ago we were running [Whisky Web](http://whiskyweb.co.uk/) for the [first time](http://whiskyweb.co.uk/2012/). 3 months from now, on April 12 and 13th, Whisky Web II is going to happen. Whisky Web last year was by far the best thing I've ever done in my life, and the one I'm the most proud of. This year should beat it. It wasn't an easy start though.

April 2nd, 2012 a blog post gets written called [Our Culture of Exlusion](http://ryanfunduk.com/culture-of-exclusion/) and starts spreading on all of the social networks. I though that months of work preparing for Whisky Web are going to get thrown away - a conference having an alcohol name in its name, all over the website and inviting to participate in a whisky master class is surely not going to get away with this. Luckily we did and managed to stay out of the fire.

It all started about a year ago when [Open Source Scotland](http://open-source-scotland.com/2012/) conference got canceled. I was suppose to speak there and I also invited a few of my friends to come, since it looked like a great time to be in Edinburgh. Sadly things didn't go well for the organizers and they were forced to cancel it. An hour later me and [Michael](http://twitter.com/mgdm) were discussing this on twitter and how "we should do something for the people who are coming anyway". So, we decided to run a conference ourselves.

At that time we didn't really realize that conferences (or events in more general terms) do not get organized in just a few months. Joined by Dale, [Max](http://twitter.com/maxmanders) and Paul, we formed a team of 5 guys who had absolutely no idea what it takes to run a conference. Luckily we were quite clever about how we were making it happen and being very agile we managed to get it all set up. Fast forward a few months, we had two days of over a 100 people, 12 speakers from as far as USA, 2 magnificent venues and a lot of fun. Oh, and a couple grand deficit. Max wrote it all down very well [here](http://www.maxmanders.co.uk/2012/05/20/whisky-web-on-organising-a-conference.html).

I don't even live in Scotland anymore, but I want to do this again because I think Scotland needs more events like this. And people who want to do them. Also after [Ben](http://twitter.com/blongden) and Ivana joined the organizers group, we are now all living in 4 different cities, so it's a truly distributed team and I don't really need to be physically present at all. Edinburgh feels like home anytime I come back to it, so this also works like a great excuse to do so.

A conference is not a room with a bunch of speakers. A conference is an environment to meet people, share ideas and experience new things. We are running it in Scotland, by far one of the most beautiful and historical countries, our *job* is to show it to the attendees. We want them to get a portion of new knowledge and meet new people, but also learn about Scotland, of course whisky and convince to come on holiday next year.

That's why this year we are going to be doing a bit of everything - mountain climbing, traveling across Scotland, dancing, fighting flying sharks, staying in a castle, etc. Some of those things are not true, some of the things which are going to happen are not there. Of course there is going to be talks too, some very good ones, but the overall experience is going to be quite a journey.

One of the bigger arguments we had is whether we should... allow people to leave on a first day, since we are meeting in Edinburgh then doing a bit of traveling and staying in the Airth castle hotel for the night coming back to Edinburgh the next day. A conference ticket includes accommodation and we are more than expecting everyone to stay there. Ask anyone who attends conferences and they will tell you, after conference socials are the things one remembers for a long long time.

So if someone wants to skip all that and just listen to the talks, please don't come. As harsh as this sounds, it's one of the *"If you have to ask then you'll never know"* moments - Whisky Web is way more than just the talks and it just makes no sense to want to experience only a part of it. We have a very limited amount of seats available, we are going to find enough people who will want to experience it all, the sort of people who went to [Funconf](/blog/funconf-fuck-yeah.html) too for example.

This might not be an event companies will send people to. We are going to have great speakers, both locally from Scotland and further away, but apart from that it is likely not very appealing as a training event. I'm ok with that, this year it's just one of the things we are strongly stating publicly and not trying to be two different things at the same time. Last year most of the people came out of their own pocket, most likely this year is going to be the same. Thus we also want people to bring their spouses.

Bringing ones wife or a husband to a conference is quite a unique feature for a conference; I haven't seen that ever actually. The technical one (or both of course) can attend all of the talks, while the other is enjoying the spa for example. All the non-talks activities of the conference are going to be suitable for everyone so we could all hang out together. I think this is quite important, because one of the main complains people get is that they always travel alone to all of these nice places.

The people who went to Whisky Web last year were overall quite happy about it, some even called it the best conference they've ever been to. I think last year was good, but this year is going to be way more solid and enjoyable. Now I only wish that what we thought would be cool is actually going to be cool for others too. See you in 3 months, [Whisky Web II](http://whiskyweb.co.uk/) is officially going to happen.
