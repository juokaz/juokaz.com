excerpt: Why you didn't check the invoice before sending it out and the client has now paid us half of the expected amount? Because I wasn't careful enough. Or maybe I was fighting zombies in the streets of Chicago while doing it on my Blackberry. Let's fix the problem first and then we can look back and see how it can be avoided the next time. If you still want to talk about it, we are going to play the blame game. Which is a really terrible way to spend our time.

What is the blame game? The blame game is the focus on the previous events and peoples' actions as opposed to the actual problem one is supposed to fix. The blame game is also what stops effective decision making and causes pointless discussions. It also drives me nuts, because I seem to be one of the few who think that none of the actions preceding an event actually matter for the process of moving on. They do matter a little bit, for the reasons of knowing the exact steps taken to end up where we are at now or similar, but that is not what they are most often used for.

People go back looking at what has been said, done or not done and use that to figure out who is the one to blame for the problem. Unless you work as a detective, which I believe is incredibly cool, you shouldn't really worry about this before actually solving the problem. Throughout the years, at least half of the emails I would get about something not being right would include *"yeah, but you said ..."*, *"but you said you are going to do ..."* or *"... was supposed to have fixed this by now"*.

I don't care at all who or what caused something to happen. What I'm interested in is how we can solve the problem. Now. This is really important. I guess even ruthless up to a point. This is also why I [dislike](/blog/why-are-you-so-boring.html) the question "why?" so much. Because I don't see why I should be caring even a little bit about the things which can't be changed anymore, it's not like I can travel back in time and fix them (that would be pretty neat). Thus I ignore them.

For example while I was [staying](/blog/love-and-horror-of-the-italian-retreat.html) in Italy, we had two car accidents. Both of those were probably mainly caused by our own faults. However rather than analyzing what we could have done differently, whose fault it was or shouting at eachother blaming for doing this, I was making everyone to start looking for solutions the moment we left the car. Because, again, it completely doesn't matter at all why that happened. What mattered is getting our asses safe back home, and that required focusing on the next steps.

I like people who can make decisions. Any decisions: work, life or fun. Most people can't. Most people are actually terrible at this. I don't think this a lost cause though, so I push everyone to do that more. If we enter a restaurant and there are 15 tables to choose from, it will take me 3 seconds to choose. I wouldn't even ask you if you think it's good too. I expect people to do the same. And most importantly not to be scared to make a bad call. There are no bad tables, it's almost a trick question.

What I do every day is I make decisions. Often times they are not easy and involve pissing someone off. That's fine. I also really don't like people discussing things for weeks when there is absolutely nothing to discuss, so I cut that off and make a call. The only reason there is a discussion is because the group doesn't have someone to make the call and move on, and others are afraid to make the call because then eventually someone is going to back and blame them for it. Blame me instead, because I don't care.

Do you think I should care? I do care about my mistakes, but you pointing them out doesn't make any difference. This also not going to make me feel bad. There is this quote by [Wayne Dyer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Dyer) which I like; it focuses on the happiness of one, but still is quite relevant since I'm not trying to focus solely on work

> All blame is a waste of time. No matter how much fault you find with another, and regardless of how much you blame him, it will not change you. The only thing blame does is to keep the focus off you when you are looking for external reasons to explain your unhappiness or frustration. You may succeed in making another feel guilty about something by blaming him, but you won't succeed in changing whatever it is about you that is making you unhappy.

We have this line at work, where from time to time we would finish a release announcement with "As always, if it doesn't work - blame Joe". Joe being me. This is partly because I carry the responsibility to make sure things don't break and also, strangely, because I've been known to break them. It all has to do with the development practices we use, which in short are that we release functionality as quickly as possible and often use the live systems as the indicator if it's broken or not.

This is because most features generate return the moment they are live, so we'd rather risk breaking things releasing them early, than perfecting them and launching weeks or months later. This has worked so far quite well. But when things do break, we too focus on the immediate steps to get them back on track, because saying "it was Joe's fault" is not going to fix anything. I did some pretty terrible decisions, some of them were quite expensive to have go wrong, but that's the cost of trying.

I really don't like whiny people. They are often the ones who would go on for days blaming each other or someone else about something what has happened, and not actually fix anything. This is extremely pointless. Focusing on the required steps to get somewhere or to fix things is what matters, anything else is just trying to avoid the responsibility. Not necessary the responsibility of making something go wrong, but the responsibility of making it better.
