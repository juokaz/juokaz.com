title: Jet.com was an obvious acquisition for Walmart
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: The problem Walmart has is that it is trying to grow two different businesses, brick-and-mortar retail and ecommerce, under one roof. This internal competition is a big issue. It’s hard to beat Amazon, who has been focused on one thing for years, while having to battle in every meeting. So where Jet.com comes in? It’s a focused company first.

Walmart is the world’s largest retailer. Yet Amazon is growing at least 20% every quarter and owns all of the US online retail.

The problem Walmart has is that it is trying to grow two different businesses, brick-and-mortar retail and ecommerce, under one roof. This internal competition is a big issue. It’s hard to beat Amazon, who has been focused on one thing for years, while having to battle in every meeting.

Two-thirds of the U.S. population lives within 5 miles of a Walmart. The same stores Walmart has perfected logistics for over the years. Yet logistics and last-mile delivery are two very different problems. It sounds obvious to use the stores for deliveries, but it has limitations - it means diverting focus from stocking them, among other things.

Not only not all products offered by Walmart in stores are available online, an understandable challenge, but how likely is Walmart to make retail profit and sales sacrifices to help ecommerce? Walmart could turn this into a massive advantage, but they need to act like one company not two.

Walmart is instead trying to fix this by building new infrastructure for ecommerce sales. More proof of the internal competition. It’s going to be an expensive and time consuming project, especially if online sales continue to stall. Analysts estimate that Walmart packages cost twice as much to ship as Amazon’s per parcel. But even if Walmart catches up in terms of fulfillment operations, that’s only a small part of the puzzle.

The biggest strength Amazon has is the 3rd-party marketplace - any retailer can sell on Amazon.com. In Q2 2016 49% of all sales were handled by marketplace sellers. By the end of the year this number will likely rise to over 50%. Furthermore, Amazon offers their fulfillment infrastructure-as-a-service via a service called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). Thus Amazon focuses on the website and logistics, while retailers focus on product sourcing.

Walmart has a marketplace too, but while the numbers are not available I’m guessing less than 10% of all Walmart.com sales are done by marketplace sellers. I’m guessing that because the Walmart marketplace has thousands of sellers compared to millions Amazon has. Walmart does not offer fulfillment service to marketplace sellers making joining it a more complicated business decision. That’s one of the reasons why it has struggled to attract a lot of attention from sellers. It’s been long rumored that the new warehouses Walmart is building are going to be available for sellers to use as well, but it hasn’t happened yet.

Nonetheless, in 2016 so far Walmart marketplace has been growing in terms of sellers much more quickly than before. Thousands have joined over the the last months, while for almost 7 years since the launch in 2009 only a handful were on the platform. However this hasn’t had any measurable impact to Walmart.com revenue yet - for the last three years every quarter showed slowing down growth for Walmart.com sales.

Ultimately Walmart is not a brand a lot of people get excited about. They tried a lot of different things, but it has remained the *massive carry-everything store* everyone remembers it to be.

So where Jet.com comes in?

It’s a focused company first. It’s a brand which has no brick and mortar history second. It’s a stellar team third.

Jet.com is innovating. For example, Jet.com provides more savings the more products are added to the cart. It’s a unique offering and has many customers excited. Jet.com also happens to have a modern design, something Amazon has neglected to improve for years. However Amazon also has over 300 million products on offer, so Jet.com is going face some big challenges to achieve the same user friendliness at that count.

What will Walmart do with Jet.com? I hope they let the existing team continue to do its thing. I think Jet.com has all the fixes Walmart needs. Walmart is better off investing into Jet.com as a brand and reducing focus on Walmart.com. It sounds crazy to think that, but I don’t see how those two platforms could help each other. There should be only one.

Since Jet.com launched last year it has burnt a lot of money to grow, making a lot of investors question how much long term potential does it have. But you need to keep in mind that Amazon has only started to return a profit recently, largely thanks to the growing AWS cloud business. Marketplaces only work when they are big, they need large communities of sellers and customers to function, so I'm not shocked by Jet.com's spending. That's the only way to make something like that work.

Based on my exposure, a lot of retailers have been experimenting with eBay over the years, but it hasn’t been all success. eBay website is a mess, and after years of continued efforts to improve it, it remains one. Newegg, BestBuy and Sears have achieved some success but are almost never brought up in conversations. None of these marketplaces got anywhere close to be a competitor for Amazon. Yet Jet.com was the one everyone saw big potential in.

Amazon is going to stay #1. No retailer is going to beat them by replaying their own formula - Jet.com and Walmart.com are almost identical to Amazon in all ways that matter. But Walmart+Jet duo has a chance to become #2.
