Today I spoke at PyCon - the largest Python programming language conference on the calendar. More than 3,000 people came to this yearly event which took place in Portland, OR on May 28th - June 5th.

My talk was titled "Building an interpreter in RPython", and covered lessons learned building a basic interpreter using the Python programming language. It's something I explored for fun, to both better understand how programming languages work and also to challenge myself in a field I had no previous experience.

Most of my days are not spent tackling complicated technical issues anymore, so I do these sort of projects to keep my skills sharp.

It's probably one of the most technical talks I've ever given - I was expecting the audience to be somewhat familiar with most of the topics covered. Here is the video of the talk.

> To understand how dynamic programming languages get executed I set out to build a PHP interpreter. Not a joke, I really did it and it worked! The final result was a well-tested piece of Python code, which could be compiled to be very performant as well. The goal of this talk is to introduce you to the basics of interpreters and the tools available in RPython to build one.
