title: Why work does happen at work
location: Auckland, New Zealand
excerpt: Recently there has been quite some discussion about working remotely or more specifically from home. There seems to be a view floating around that working remotely just involves taking ones laptop and instead of going to work every morning you just sit on your couch and start hacking on things whenever you wake up. That's what a lot of people do and eventually fail. Because work is way more than just doing your tasks. Work is also building relationships with your team, seeing what others are up to and occasionally getting drunk in a bar after work.

Recently there has been quite some discussion about working remotely or more specifically from home. There seems to be a view floating around that working remotely just involves taking ones laptop and instead of going to work every morning you just sit on your couch and start hacking on things whenever you wake up. That's what a lot of people do and eventually fail. Because work is way more than just doing your tasks. Work is also building relationships with your team, seeing what others are up to and occasionally getting drunk in a bar after work.

So let's drop the fairytale and just be honest - working away from the office is not for everyone. It's actually a skill just a minority posses. Majority think they can work remotely and thus the million trending articles, but someone is probably not being a great manager and not telling them they should really look into improving their work processes. A process which is so easy to define for on-site employees, but is very tricky to figure out when you have people all over the place and time.

It all started with Jason Fried giving a talking titled [Why work doesn't happen at work](http://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work.html) and as much as I like that guy, he is oversimplifying this whole thing. What they have setup is great, and you can read more about their company's office setup on their website, but it only works because of the people they have hired and the fact that the company has been historically built aiming for this sort of structure. But most companies are not built this way and especially for big corporations it can become quite a challenge to manage this all.

If a company is not fully distributed, especially if the majority of the staff is working from one single location, it's extremely difficult to make off-site work possible. It's not just about allowing those people to do their work from elsewhere, it's the fact that they are likely going to be very much out of touch with others. Random conversations happening over the lunch are very important, IRC is not going to replace that (which only works for IT people anyway) and email is just too slow and dry.

Everyone seems to assume I'm a very angry evil person who is always complaining and arguing. Ignoring the chance of that actually being true, this is purely because my emails come about as such. I've been looking into this and I still can't figure out why, but I've been aware that others assume they are more negative than not. And that's why I've been spending more and more time on calls, it's just so much better at avoiding misconceptions and making quick decisions, which is very important. Although I guess I can just start adding more smilies, especially after calling someone an idiot.

You know what is even more effective than calling? Yes, asking in person. It does distract you when someone asks you for something right in a middle of you working on something, but at the same time, if you were to do this via email the other person would be forced to wait for you to answer until he can continue. Having a team in one place is just plain effective. And if your now remote team is across different timezones, sometimes simple things can take days of emailing back and forward just because you are not having your work day at the same time as others do.

Of course you can try to work during normal work hours, but if you are working from home... you might as well not, what's the point in that if you are not in the office anyway? But this is a very horrible life style. Trust me. Actually what I found to be the most difficult is work and life balance. When you are doing both from the same physical space the line is so thin it tends to disappear. And that massively upsets things. Unless you can allocate a spare room for your office, going for co-working places is your best bet. Working from home is just not good.

A lot of the people I know, which I guess is not very significant statistically, are just horrible at motivating themselves. That's even assuming they are working in a position which requires motivation, because if it doesn't (like most "normal" jobs) this whole remote stunt is definitely not going to work. That's why being at work is so important for them, because that puts them in a place which constantly reminds them that they should be working and not doing any other million things. And that helps a lot, because it creates a disconnect from where you are expected to work and where you can watch some football.

And when they work from home they do those million other things instead of working. Because trying to get work done on the computer, with all the internet has to offer, is like trying to read a book in a strip club. It's so easy to go do other, more interesting things. I've been using time tracking apps to figure out where I'm spending my time during the day and also focus-improving plugins for web browsers to block certain time wasting websites from 8am till 11pm (that's stuff like Facebook et al.), so right now I think I'm extremely productive. But a lot of people I've seen working from home can barely do 6 hours of work a day, even though they think they spent 10 hours working.

When you are drunk, you don't know how clumsy you are until you sober up. The principles of drinking. This work for everything in life, work included. Not being productive can only be observed from outside and only some time later by yourself. And this while remote work concept is all about how to be more productive, so... It can only be productive you have the same sort of ethic as you would working from the office with a boss on your shoulders. Which is obvious to assume, but tends not to happen.

If work can be structured in such a way that every employee is working on his own piece and eventually brings it to you so you could build the final puzzle, then you are either working in a charcoal mine or you should be replaced by a robot. In most cases, building successful teams requires... building them. So when talking about remote work, realize that it's not as simple as not coming to the office. It requires actual effort and changes in the company. Is it worth it?

One hundred and one percent yes. I've been [working](/blog/getting-work-done-and-being-busy.html) from all sorts of random places, timezones and environments (think in bed at 3am having conference calls). I enjoy it a lot, I'm not sure I will be ever able to squeeze myself into an office rhythm. But. It's not for everyone. It's a skill which takes time to develop and a lot of work from others to make sure distributed teams are performing well. Work does happen at work, it's delusional to assume remote work is better. It could be though.
