title: Exponential Organizations
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: Airbnb is the biggest hotel in the world, yet owns zero properties. This has allowed it to scale way beyond other *hotels*. Hilton is still growing, but for every 1% growth in revenue they need to build that many more properties. They can’t increase the prices, they can’t fit more people in the rooms. They are kind of stuck. Uber, GitHub, Etsy, even Amazon, are all benefiting from the same thing. They own very few resources, yet are able to grow the bottom line exponentially.

If there is any book which captures my vision it has to be [Exponential Organizations](http://www.amazon.com/Exponential-Organizations-organizations-better-cheaper/dp/1626814236) by Salim Ismail. For non technical people it’s an eye opener why some startups have grown so much so quickly. For me, it helped to validate my own ideas on how a modern business should operate.

Airbnb is the biggest hotel in the world, yet owns zero properties. This has allowed it to scale way beyond other *hotels*. Hilton is still growing, but for every 1% growth in revenue they need to build that many more properties. They can’t increase the prices, they can’t fit more people in the rooms. They are kind of stuck. Uber, GitHub, Etsy, even Amazon, are all benefiting from the same thing. They own very few resources, yet are able to grow the bottom line exponentially. This is one of the key points in the book, and the one I want to focus here.

One of the classic businesses is retail. Buy low, sell high. Today though there are companies at both the retail and wholesale side of the market, selling products they haven’t even seen. In oil and coal markets no one is even actually buying the product, the trades are for virtual ownership (unless you get a [barge of coal](http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Special-Delivery) delivered to your office). It’s not uncommon to use 3rd party logistics providers to not only offload deliveries, but also warehousing. So the whole business can be operated from Bali, while products travel from manufacturers in China to end customers in the US.

Software should be rented as well.

I spend majority of my time talking to companies about their business and how software could grow it. Many of them want to own software. This is almost always a wrong idea. Because instead of getting immediate benefits from something already on the market. They want to either build it, which delays the benefits, or buy it, which has a steep upfront cost. Thus I focus on the concept of renting resources and how that is the only way to succeed now. As the book puts it “Any company designed for success in the 20th century is doomed to failure in the 21st”. Owning software is, albeit late, a 20th century thing.

It used to be common for companies to go out and find a software firm to write a program for them. Which they then end up failing to spend money on to maintain. Thus a few years down the road it’s the central frustration point for the whole organization. However it’s so inflexible that rebuilding it is astronomically expensive and no one wants to sign off on it. Almost a classic [catch 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22_%28logic%29) situation.

Instead businesses started to grow development teams in house. Even if the company had no goal to become a technical one, it was logical to have a tech department. Saves on massive costs to get the work done by a third-party company, yet all the proprietary stuff is maintained and very efficient. Works pretty well. But can lead to situations where instead of taking an off-the-shelf solution which already does everything they need. They rewrite it themselves because why not, the team can do it.

When all you have is developers, every problem loooks like a software problem.

For a book store in downtown Manhattan it makes no sense to create their own warehousing tools. There are thousands of them out there. But if they have a team of developers sitting *doing nothing*, why not just do it. And many of them do. This is a terrible strategy. And as shown by other examples, it grows the amount of resources owned. However software is not like buying a warehouse, in house software cannot be sold and replaced even remotely as easily.

As Sam puts it in [GitHub: Scaling on Ruby, with a nomadic tech team](https://medium.com/s-c-a-l-e/github-scaling-on-ruby-with-a-nomadic-tech-team-4db562b96dcd) when talking about their own efforts at GitHub:

> We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, we don’t need to write our own databases, we don’t need to start writing our own frameworks — because they’re all in domains that are usual. It’s a website, it’s web hosting. In the domains that are unusual, we fully embrace the need to write custom applications or build bespoke apps for that.

The point is that a technical company should create in house solutions, *aka* incur technical debt, for problems unique to the issue they are solving. For any other company, they shouldn’t go near writing or buying software. Instead they should pay $100 a month for something someone already spent 10’000 hours on. It might look more expensive, but only if you are not taking into consideration all the alternative costs.

Salesforce.com is almost at a [$10 billion run rate](http://venturebeat.com/2015/09/19/salesforce-coms-ascent-to-10b-signals-major-economic-shift-ahead/). Because enough people have realized the benefits of both someone else solving the problem and not paying for it up front. Microsoft and Oracle are 20th century winners, Salesforce.com and a few more are going to own 21st century. Of course, it doesn’t work for all cases. But to grow exponentially is to not to own software.

There are a few [fundamental requirements](/blog/expectations-for-modern-applications.html) for the software to be used. The most important one being that the data should be importable/exportable and accessible via some sort of automation. Then when things get serious software strategy could always be changed. Outside of that, if a business wants to sell some things online and the solution they get is a proprietary ecommerce site, the got screwed. It will work, but that was not the right thing to do.

What many of the recent startups have shown is that the best strategy right now is to focus on the thing you do best. And to not try to solve any other problems. When it comes to software, that means unless you are trying to become a truly technical firm, software is not your *thing*. You should treat it as an external resource and have someone else take care of it for you. Not a revolutionary idea, but today that means jumping on software as a service products.

“rent it, don’t own it”
