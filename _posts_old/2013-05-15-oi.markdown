By definition punk [subculture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_subculture) is all about individual freedom and anti-establishment views. As you might have noticed, these are the sort of qualities I believe in too. While I don't consider myself belonging to the punks group, I consider myself being a punk. If that makes sense. And I have always been one, but getting the mohawk done allowed to have a visible *token* so others could see that too.

What others saw was not necessary punk though. Having a mohawk and dressing as I do means that a lot of people are struggling to understand what sort of person I really am. So they come and ask me. On average at least once in two days someone comes to me just to talk. Oh and at least once a week someone comes to have a picture taken with me. I'm not kidding. This was weird at first, but by now it's pretty interesting having to talk to all sorts of different people and explain them why I do all these things.

Shockingly most of my me friends, some of them are not anymore, didn't understood this. I was expecting them to know that I might do something like this one day, because it's not like something has drastically changed one day. I used to be a nice boy and a day later I turn into this rebel. That's how they saw it. Or that I have lost a bet, which has happened many times in the past, and this was the price to pay. It just took me a while to shave off my hair, it takes some courage to make that final step. It's not even about the hair. Hair grows back (annoyingly quickly when you want to have it shaved, pro tip).

I was standing in a bar in London, quite a nice one, at a pretty late time and being quite bored when a girl approached me and asked how come I have my hair like this. Because I can, of course. She obviously thought I have to be an artist of some sort to be able to look like this at work, so when I told her what I actually do that shocked her a bit. I think that's pretty sad. So I looked around and everyone around me were default London suits, so I pointed at them and said that they are all defined by social norms. And I'm not.

Why I consider myself being a punk? Because I do things I want to be doing and I don't do things just because someone told me not to. For example the [homeless](/blog/living-homeless.html) stunt is a great example of that. As much as it is about not having a place and living somewhere else every week, it's much more about the lifestyle. I have created a freedom for myself. A very real one. In that freedom I play by my own rules. That's what punk is all about to me.

I don't necessary think people should be breaking social norms all the time, but at the same time they have all given up their individuality for trying to be part of some sort of group of people. During the [FoundersCard](https://founderscard.com/home) event in New York City, which is a gathering of entrepreneurs and similar minded people, I ended up leaving with a huge stack of business cards. This is the sort of environment where you would assume mohawks just wont belong, because... well, you would assume. But this is not the case. Having a mohawk actually works as a great conversation starter and also raises the interest of others to come and talk to me.

What is strange to everyone is that I have no problems talking to any groups of people at all. So far. I've been to many serious events and meetings since and it never caused someone to not treat me right. I have also been to a lot of different social environments and never had problems there too. For example at conferences it helps people to recognize me, which is pretty useful as I'm there to talk to as many different people to share my view, so if people know who I am without even talking to me it works out great.

It's only at conferences where I need people to know me, having random people recognize you has absolutely no good. Having people take photos with you everywhere you go gets boring quick. These are all additional and not important things. What is important to me is the people who have appreciated and respected my views. Even if some of them asked if I do drugs, have tattoos or... if I am gay, whatever this has to do with mohawks. It has exposed me to many new people and also showed how boring most of them have become. It's a one big social experiment.

After one conference me and my fellow mohawk friend stayed in Prague to explore Czech Republic. Then we were really living the punk life. And we really looked like ones. Then no one knew what is it exactly that I do. Everyone assumed something lame. That's not good, because we have come to associate all these subgroups with not having a good life, being broke or just not getting along with others. One by one I'm trying to teach others that this is a very prejudice thing to assume.

There are may others stories which all happened because I had a mohawk, many many great memories and only a few bad experiences. Mostly because it seems like there is less and less *alternative* people in the world. Especially in USA. Everyone has come to trying to blend in. However having your hair done is not going to turn you into a rebel. It's only a token, it is much more about what you believe in. But some of these things require a physical change to show that you believe in them strongly enough. I realized that.
