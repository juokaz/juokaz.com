title: Comfort kills creativity
location: New York, NY, USA
excerpt: Procrastination kills any possibility for having ideas for me. In my experience, just going through the motions of doing the task will both make you better at it and create opportunities. No matter if it is looking for a job or trying to get the first sale, committing to it every day is the quickest path to success. For example, instead of waiting for that big project idea and going all in, I work on whatever idea I have at the moment. By the time a good idea comes I’ll at least have plenty of experience.

I’m a huge fan of Jack White. In this [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJgY9FtDLbs) with Conan O’Brien he discusses many things about his music and his creative process. They start by talking about Jack White forcing himself into a strict and limiting environment. Because, he argues, having no boundaries never leads to anything good. Instead of waiting for an inspiration and then quickly writing it down on a napkin, he writes songs when he has the studio time booked.

> “I’ll write some songs and when I’m done with them, I’ll call you guys and show up”. It won’t happen. 

Artists are commonly portrayed as inspired creatives who do their best work when they have a grand idea. In reality, though, it seems that having a strict approach works better. Jack White for example does not rely on post-production to fix his sloppy work later. It also focuses on simplicity in the work created. Yet John Cleese insists that there two equally important modes of operation - open and closed. In his [talk](http://vimeo.com/89936101) on creativity.

> The open mode is more relaxed, more receptive, more exploratory, more democratic, more playful and more humorous.
>
> The closed mode is the tighter, more rigid, more hierarchical, more tunnel-visioned.

Instead of always staying in the Jack White-like closed mode, one should switch between them as needed. Closed mode is great for getting abstract things done, but the focus of it might leave other areas unexplored.

Everyone agrees, though, that being in a creative position is not all waiting for an inspiration. Not only that, this is not about art alone. This works for any job when trying to achieve productivity. [Screw motivation, what you need is discipline](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) hits the nail on the head. Discipline is the closed mode described by John Cleese. Instead of looking for inspiration, having the discipline to just do things is usually better. Motivation is needed for long-term ideas, but short-term it causes blank canvas paralysis. Not being able to move because it doesn’t feel right. Bad.

Procrastination kills any possibility for having ideas for me. In my experience, just going through the motions of doing the task will both make you better at it and create opportunities. No matter if it is looking for a job or trying to get the first sale, committing to it every day is the quickest path to success. For example, instead of waiting for that big project idea and going all in, I work on whatever idea I have at the moment. By the time a good idea comes I’ll at least have plenty of experience.

Thus I have been writing code every day for over [600 days](https://twitter.com/juokaz/status/556206229023129600). I started doing this after I read the [Don’t Break the Chain](http://www.writersstore.com/dont-break-the-chain-jerry-seinfeld/) Jerry Seinfeld's method for getting good at a something. Like picking up an instrument to play, ultimately all it needs is practicing playing it as much as possible. Getting into the habit of doing it, even if for 5 minutes a day, sooner or later will make you good at it. “*The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried*” – Stephen McCranie.

I draw inspiration from sports and military. Both achieve mental and physical strength through discipline. The way greatness is achieved in [Whiplash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582802/) sounds just about right to me. Practices set up long time ago still work. It’s not a creative environment even by a far stretch. Yet it cultivates getting the work done and pushing beyond what seemed possible. While most workplaces enforce discipline by strict work hours, no phone policy, increasingly more people seem to forget why that’s needed.

Alain de Botton, in his brilliant talk [The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNKOpjgS5ao), talks about the role work plays in our lives. He points to the switch from doing a job as a simply a task, to looking for emotional enrichment through it. But by seeking for jobs we care about and have passions for, we seem to have lost the ability to just get things done. Work environments are becoming purely open mode systems. Open plan, show up at any hours, work on things that interest you, foosball to kill time kind of places. While they look relaxing and much more pleasurable, I have a hunch that the produced outcome is not that great. No one is passionate about spreadsheets. Who will work on them once everyone won’t touch jobs they are not passionate about?

Getting the right mix of open and closed modes is thus the key. A lot of people start startups because “they can’t have a boss” and don’t want to fall into the 9-5 lifestyle. While a pretty weak reason, it is also wrong. Working for someone is much easier than running things yourself. While one can do anything he wants and show up at the office as he pleases, you need discipline not to. This overly relaxed approach to work will mean you won’t get anything done.

It all started to make sense once I started hitting the gym often. I realized that the only way to advance is by patience and discipline. It’s all down to the individual. With that mindset, creating healthy boundaries and limits for work has worked wonders. Especially when it comes to creative tasks like exploring new ideas.
