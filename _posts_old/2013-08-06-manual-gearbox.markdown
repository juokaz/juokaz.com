excerpt: Apparently men are horrible nowadays - no longer anyone cares enough to setup a romantic date, but it's all a social network-driven platonic chit chat. I've seen a countless number of my friends share this or a similar article as if to complain about their relationships. Bloody hipsters. The fact that 10 years ago people used to do things differently doesn't make it somehow better. Remember when women's only purpose was to get married, wash dishes and have dinner ready for her fine-dressed husband?

Apparently [men are horrible nowadays](http://elitedaily.com/life/culture/why-men-arent-really-men-anymore/) - no longer anyone cares enough to setup a romantic date, but it's all a social network-driven platonic chit chat. I've seen a countless number of my friends share this or a similar article as if to complain about their relationships. Bloody hipsters. The fact that 10 years ago people used to do things differently doesn't make it somehow better. Remember when women's only purpose was to get married, wash dishes and have dinner ready for her fine-dressed husband?

But wait, of course it was all shared on Facebook. Doesn't it sound a bit [hypocritical](/blog/online-privacy-hypocrites.html) to share something in a place which the same article is portraying as bad? I'm pretty sure every single person who shared this did so because of someone, but rather than sending this to them, or, you know, talking to them, they did the same thing they are apparently disagreeing with doing. At the same time, less and less people see a problem to mark a random person they just met as a "friend".

Everyone now has hundreds or even thousands of friends, a number which would be practically impossible to have if not for the social networks. There is no more thrill about getting to know someone, social networks solve it all - exchanging phone numbers is becoming rather pointless as it is all going to be available as soon as you'll become their friend. And once you do, you can know it all, and by all I mean you can see their illusion they are trying to make, carefully crafting what others are going to see about them.

However this is not a problem at all. In the same fashion as people are no longer writing letters, something which used to be the only communication way not so long ago, social networks is how we communicate now. As much as that might seem wrong, it is just how we are going to have to play. We as a species are evolving all the time and all the technologies have changed how we do certain things. Looking back those things were definitely way more direct and in-person, but the fact they are absolutely cold now is just how it is.

The only reason why things from the past seem better is because we know and understand them. Acceptable. But new things are popping up all the time and are challenging our perception. More and more people now have smartphones on them, allowing them to be online all the time. You can now go to a bar, talk about something, figure out that someone hasn't seen the Star Wars trilogy and buy it on the spot so it arrives the morning you wake up. I still haven't seen them, but that's what smartphones allow now.

Summer used to to be the dark season of e-commerce. Everyone is on holidays and away from the computers thus no time to buy anything. This is no longer the case. As the summer arrives, there is no change in sales velocity - it's all coming from mobile devices now. At the same time, loads of companies and projects have websites which are unusable on them. You have to deaf, dumb and blind to do that. Mobile devices are not on the rise - mobiles devices are *the* devices people use to access the internet. The change has already happened.

That change has also caused everyone to take photos of everything they eat, drink and... touch? This might seem absolutely pointless, and it really is, but social networks are some kind of a game. A game which requires, if you participate in it, to share cool things one does. And I've seen many people arguing how stupid this all this turn around and go all in. Sharing photos with someone you are secretly dating as if no one understands why you are sharing them. Better than a picture of a schnitzel for sure.

It is weird to admit to ourselves that we are changing how we go about our lives because a group of geeks are deciding this somewhere in the Silicon Valley. Instagram made it extremely easy to take good photos. A square crop makes it way easier to frame a shot right and the available color filters make any random photo look neat. Big groups of photographers are unhappy about this, because a kid with an iPhone can now get a bigger audience for his photos than a professional photographer with thousands of dollars worth of gear and years of experience.

The clever ones created their Instagram accounts too and are doing great there, anyone else is complaining how idiotic it is and how *real* photographers are so much better. Well, photography is all about capturing a moment. Smartphones are always there, so the small change of figuring out how to turn their photos into great looking shots is all what was needed. Rather than hiring a photographer for a wedding, just ask everyone to take as many photos as they can. Obviously they are not going to match the quality, but they are going to capture so much more from all sorts of different angles. On a mobile screen it is all going to look the same anyway.

Anyone arguing against are trying to fight change. That is not going work. No argument is valid because people are already using it, so whatever drawbacks it has are irrelevant. Shut up. A lot of start ups are trying to *disrupt* something, a lot of times by trying to fix problems no one has or they don't understand, but a lot of social networks disrupt the social interactions incredibly effectively. Looking back at what we did 5 years ago is completely different. I can't remember when was the last time I emailed someone for non-work reasons.

There is no point obsessing, or being ironic, about things from the *past*. Change is good. When I find myself reading articles how current generation don't know how to talk to people anymore, rather than call people text cryptic messages, and rely on social networks to block their shyness, I think people writing them are wishing for a time-machine. Not saying time-machines are bad, I would absolutely love to have one. Everyone plays differently now.

Even if social networks are eroding our social skills, this is evolution. We have found a different way to do something and we went for it. It might be not as pure and expressive as what we had before, but it is what it is.
