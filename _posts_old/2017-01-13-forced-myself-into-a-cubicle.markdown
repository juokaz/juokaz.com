When you walk around Downtown Manhattan you'll notice that most people are wondering around aimlessly. Grabbing an afternoon coffee or on their way home back from a gym. On a regular day you might wonder if any of these people have jobs.

But it only takes 10 minutes on a subway going north to get to Midtown Manhattan and things change. All of a sudden people there have a purpose. Going to, from or for work. No one is wondering around.

That's why after having spent a long time in coffee shops and working from home I got an office. I want to be in a environment where people *work*. Because I looked at what I have been doing, and realized that I can get more done in less time by having a strict work environment.

Coffee shops are too distracting, working from home is too isolated.

So starting now this is where I'll spend my days - in a goddamn cubicle in Midtown Manhattan.

*&uarr; This is my desk.*

It's part of a coworking office, so I get all the benefits like a community to chat when I feel like to. But I also have my own room where I can focus. It's the right environment to make me productive.

My company is, of course, remote, which gives me a lot of flexibility. But flexibility is where productivity disappears. To get it back, everyone figures out their own constrains. Having a defined work place is one. Having defined work hours is second. It's kind of like rebuilding a work day out of building blocks to be what you want it to be.

We are all trying our hardest working on ideas to avoid having to work for a big corporation, and yet I find myself in a cubicle. Go figure.
