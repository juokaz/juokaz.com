title: Your three ugly friends
location: Melbourne, Australia
excerpt: Prettiness is a relative thing. One is as pretty as ugly his friends are. Is he not? I think he is. That's how it works. It is a nice feeling to be pretty, no denying that, but relative things eventually find a new anchor point. And he becomes the ugliest face in the room. So maybe he shouldn't have stayed in the same room for so long?

Prettiness is a relative thing. One is as pretty as ugly his friends are. Is he not? I think he is. That's how it works.

I like to dress sharply. I also like going to nice cocktail bars where others are well dressed too. At the same time, I have friends who *hate* these sort of places and would much rather stay at a local pub. Pubs are fine, but maybe the reason they hate the classy bars is because they know their jeans are not going to be good enough there. Their hate is nothing more than a way to protect themselves. People want to feel comfortable at the end of the day, but oh boy is this dangerous. It doesn't matter if you like fancy bars or not, they are there for people who do.

Don't convince yourself that there is something bad about them or the people who go there, you are blocking the other view. The other view, though, is very important. Wouldn't you be interested to know why these people dress what-they-consider-well? Wouldn't you be interested to know why they like complicated cocktails as opposed to a pint of beer? I do. There is a reason for everything and the reason people do something is always interesting. It explains what makes other people tick, it shows that what you are doing is only best from your view.

Assuming whatever you are doing is the best is dangerous. It's even delusional. Because that can only happen as long as you stay caged inside a given social network and assume everything in the world comes from there. This is where *"everyone"* and *"no one"* come from. People see the whole world as just a bigger version of their social network. If all of their friends are using iPhones, then clearly Android reported market share is false. This is bad. This is making what looks to be an objective view to be very subjective.

Many many years ago we used to live splattered all over the Europe and the people we would see in our lifetime were the people in our community or later village. A lot of people operate as if this was still the case. It's not. Nowadays modern communication are accessible to quite a big portion of the world and we can know what everyone is doing almost in real time. Not a lot of people are using this privilege though, they lock themselves in to believe that none of this matters and only their friends and family circuit is what provides valuable input.

Let's calm down for a second. Maybe people don't want to explore other networks. If you are in a good position now, looking out might make you depressed. Realizing how better, in all senses of the world, others are. Limiting the exposure is safe. I don't like safe, nor I think should you. There are so many great people in this world, excelling at all sorts of different fields, not looking at them to blindfold oneself from realizing how much more advanced others are is not good. You are stupid. You are ugly. But that's fine.

Being the smartest person in the room is bad. Everyone knows that. It creates a sense of superiority and promotes stagnation. While everyone else is absorbing your knowledge and experience to one day be better than you, you are enjoying being the star. For now. Don't deny it. Sooner or later you are going to change your job or move to another team and realize you are not that smart. What's going to happen then? If you care about your future you will adapt and learn, if not, you will find a reason to leave. Your boss hates you, for example.

Other networks help one realize that they might not even care about the things he does. Sebastian Vettel went to speak at the David Letterman show once where he told a [story](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3hr2PV40z0#t=8m15s) about how he got asked by USA immigration officer "Did you have a good seat?" when flying back from a race in Canada. Vettel has won the world championship 3 years in a row now, if you have even a small interest in cars you definitely have heard of him. But that's less than 1% population, for everyone else he is just a random German guy.

Famous people are as famous as the number of people who seen them do their work. For example I haven't seen any of the Star Wars movies, something tech people assume everyone did, and I don't get any of the jokes or know any supposedly famous actors from there. They might be cool from your point of view, but I have no idea who they even are. Even the names don't ring a bell. I find this great, because I know so many other things in other fields I can share, but many people operate under the assumption that whatever they like, saw or did is something others did too.

This is especially visible in social networks. When you ask a question, post a link or some thought, you have to realize that the people reacting to it are all from your network. Whatever you are thinking, they are likely thinking the same. If you get *a lot* of people to agree with you - great - but you have to realize that this is only because they all come from the same limited network. The people who may disagree might not even seen this message. The perception of general agreement is there, but it's just a mirage.

Recently Google announced that they are shutting down their Reader application. This was quite a surprise to a lot of us, because we've been using it for a years. All the tech people went to scream about that in pain, and if you looked at what your friends were saying, assuming you were one of the screaming ones, it really looked like everyone was upset. But that's a false assumption to make, regarding the everyone. Google cares about building big products, how many Facebook users were complaining about that? Not a lot. But Facebook users are the users Google wishes to have.

The people who surround you are very valuable, but they are giving you a fake view of the world. The issues they talk about are important, to them, but you have to realize that there are so many other people who think differently. Try to look around - it's nice to be the prettiest girl at the prom dance, but that's going to quickly fade a way. Haven't tried though myself, so don't trust me on that.
