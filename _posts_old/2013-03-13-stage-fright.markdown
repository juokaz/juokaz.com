excerpt: I do a substantial amount of public speaking, roughly once every month for the past couple of years. I hate doing so. However when I started doing it I knew it's going to be very important in a long run, so I just pulled myself together and went to explore the unknown. One of the few things I forced myself to do, even though we both, the sane and insane me, knew it won't be an easy ride.

I do a substantial amount of public speaking, roughly once every month for the past couple of years. I hate doing so. However when I started doing it I knew it's going to be very important in a long run, so I just pulled myself together and went to explore the unknown. One of the few things I forced myself to do, even though we both, the sane and insane me, knew it won't be an easy ride.

In late 2009 I attended my first conference and left thinking that the speakers there, no offense, weren't doing anything magical, pretty sure I should be able to do the same. Throw some slides together about something I was working on and talk about it. Few months later I was supposed to to do my first real talk and I was ready to punch myself. If that was somehow possible. Luckily I didn't and the talk went quite well. Up to this day though I don't like giving talks. For exactly half a day before my talk.

Shouldn't I stop doing them if I don't like that so much? Well. No. I need to be doing this. I have a few friends who have a natural gift for public speaking, great voice, clear flow and... And I don't. But conference speaking has brought me so many great things, especially professionally, that I just have to do it. So I'm learning, practicing and listening to what others are doing to become a great speaker. Even if I don't like people.

Being an [introvert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion) and speaking at conferences is strange. The definition of it states that I should be fearing people. I guess in a sense I do, but I have no problem being on stage - I really have no stage fright. I have no problem calling my audience idiots too. Actually that's not true. I don't have a problem anymore. I've built up quite some confidence to be really opinionated in those years. You should check out me talking sometime, it's quite entertaining.

Confidence is something what introverts lack. I certainly did. What going to all these conferences has taught me is how to go to a big gathering of strangers and meet people to talk to. This is pretty useful when applied to bars too. It's definitely not something I enjoyed doing at first, but after doing on so many different occasions, it just doesn't feel awkward anymore. Especially since the mohawk, which introduced me to so many new people everywhere I go.

Going to conferences means loads of travel. Which means taxis, trains, check-ins, queues, delays and layovers. All sorts of tiny inconveniences. Sometimes a 6AM flight would slip past, I have a rule for my travels' girl to not ever book me anything in a morning, and as I'm sitting in a cab even before the sunrise I'm crying inside. Why am I doing this?! It would be so much nicer to have a good night of sleep. That feeling is only there for a few minutes, but it is depressing. I was really never an outgoing person and this is making me uncomfortable so often.

Once in a while I would go to sleep, in yet another different bed I'm sleeping that night, and think about how nice it is to have a home. It's not so much about the physical space being called home, it's way more about feeling at home. When everything is familiar, as you like it to be and just there. But now I don't have a home [anymore](/blog/living-homeless.html). I miss that. Before that I would wake up in a morning and think about all the things I need to do today. I would feel happier if I didn't have to go anywhere and can spend whole day working from home. Not sure why. I'm weird that way.

The maximum time I would spend at one place so far has been a month, which is nowhere enough to start feeling like at home. So this whole love for staying in is no longer available. I leave the place I'm staying at now every day, even if I don't have any a reason to do so. I'm also working way more from co-working places or libraries, because I learned that it is just so much better than working from home. If this continues, I'll be only back home, when I have one, to sleep. Which will be great.

Not having a home also means I have to source food differently - I cook very rarely now. I tend to rely on restaurants. I hate going to places like that alone, though. When it comes to bars, restaurants or even coffee shops, they are really not designed for people coming on their own. But that's just because so many people don't have the confidence to do so. Since you can't rely on friends to fill the time with conversations, you have to find new ones or come up with something else. That's not easy, and people like easy things, so it just doesn't happen often.

By now I don't care. I can show up at at a restaurant and have a dinner without having that awkward feeling. And without starring at my iPhone screen for most of the time. Something people do so often now, even when they are with someone. I would still much prefer having someone to join me, it's nice to have a good conversation, but if not, and that's very common when I go to places I know no one, that doesn't mean I have to eat at home. I have no home.

Realizing things one needs to improve or do to be better is not easy. However actually doing them and being patient enough to wait past the uncomfortableness is really tough. All of those things I talked about I'd rather not be doing. If I was writing this two years ago. Now I'm happy I did them, they changed me. Stage fright only exists before going up the stage, once you are there, you can even get friends to physically force you up the stairs, you'd be surprised how normal it feels.
