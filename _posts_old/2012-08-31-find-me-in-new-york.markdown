After living in Edinburgh for 4 years, it's time to move. I knew I would be moving quite a long time ago and spent a lot of time planning and testing a few different ideas. I wanted to change the city I was living in, not because I hated it, but because I consider myself too young to stay in one place, the work I was doing and all what surrounds that.

What I was looking for, is an opportunity to work on something which would have a an impact, a place of work where I could see a true outcome of my work. And while my business in UK was continuously growing and financially I was way more than covered, I never enjoyed it. Not one day. But I was definitely not going to join a company as just an employee - I never had a fulltime job working for someone else and that wasn't going to change. Not unless I get to have a say in business.

While I still can *afford to* (not financially, but socially), I like to travel around as much as possible, and have always had USA in my plans as a place to live. However you can't just show up at the border of USA and be allowed in - you have to get a Visa, which in most cases has to come through work. Thus I had to find something pretty unique, which would suit me personally, allowing to live and enjoy USA, and also work.

Luckily one of our clients, I would like to assume because of our work, was growing every month and after a few months of discussions, it was decided that it makes most sense for me to join them and be part of the business. Yet another example of the classical talent acquisition, but I would strongly argue that it just made a lot of sense - our goals were heading the same way. Using technologies to grow businesses.

The client, which from now I should probably start referring to as *us*, is a retail company, medium sized (>50 employees), mainly selling through ecommerce channels, and most importantly to me, has realized the potential of technologies even before I came on board. You see, as far as I'm concerned, whole ecommerce market is mostly, and by mostly I mean 99.9%, filled with trivial webstores listing their products and expecting people to find them and buy their products. Well, that's not going to work.

One has to realize that ecommerce stores' clients are different from the retail stores' ones - they, in most cases, don't care about much else expect the price. Price. That's where you can make an impact. If you can sell at the right price at a right point in time - you are making money. How much money depends on for how much you can sell, obviously. But how you are going to do that, if you say have a 100'000 products on sale?

You would sit down and manually enter the price for each product. Sounds stupid? Tell that to majority of the stores. But that's just one side of the problem - you can't just sell for the cheapest price of the market, you need to be more clever than that. And that's where algorithmic trading comes in, a term you might have heard associated with the stock market. That's where it belongs, but I'm taking it on myself to lead the innovation to introduce this to ecommerce market. 

Not only checking all competitors' prices, but also knowing how to **make them** to sell for more so we could sell for more too, predict market trends, estimate and execute orders from suppliers to only keep the minimum required stock, etc. Just a bunch of math, something I really missed doing, hundreds of gigabytes data processed every day and millions of decisions made 24/7. 

For years I've been convincing every one - data is the king. As soon as you can figure out how to acquire the data you need to make a decision, you are good to go. So that's what I'm going to be working on; pushing the boundaries of what is now ecommerce and coming up with ways to offload as much as possible work to computers to let them think for themselves. The cool bit? I already know it will work, because the systems we have now, which I would call childish in terms of what they can do, are already paying off.

But I don't want to stop my involvement in web development and design industry, thus our side company is going to be doing that. We have a lot of great ideas in mind and quite a few projects to bootstrap, which would also allow me to get involved with the community in New York and start helping out with the user group(-s). This is similar to what I've been doing in Edinburgh, but now at a substantially bigger scale.

That's that. I went from being a CEO of my own little company, to be a CTO of two companies in USA. Two companies for now, both myself and as a group with other partners, we have ideas which will turn into businesses as we see fit. It's a very exciting time for me, achieving all of the things I was looking for and not only allowing me to work on something truly great, but also grow something which would benefit me personally and a group of a lot of people. 

I'm writing this with only a few hours left until I fly to Dublin, leaving Edinburgh as my permanent place of living... Until I get my visa, I'll be, and I'm not joking here, homeless and will spend all the time traveling; just me, my laptop and a small bag. It's 21st century at the end of a day, I don't have to be at any certain place to get my work done, so I might as well just go where I can have a good time. But that whole story is for a next time.
