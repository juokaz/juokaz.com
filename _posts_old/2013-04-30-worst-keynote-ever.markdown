Two weeks ago I was giving an outdoors keynote just outside of the Scottish parliament in Edinburgh while a police officer silently observed what looked like an illegal protest. It might just have been the best way to open [Whisky Web II](http://whiskyweb.co.uk/), the conference six of us spent half a year organizing, because it was the worst keynote ever.

A substantial number of people complained about our model of a residential conference, having whisky in our name and many other random things they thought they knew better than us. They are all wrong. Seeing other similar conferences also getting great [reviews](http://paddy.io/posts/realtimeconfeu/), I know that there are enough people to understand this. It just takes a certain amount of willingness to try something different. Even if an hour of waiting to see whether anyone would show up was the longest hour in years.

It wasn't suppose to start like this. I invited my good friend [Eamon Leonard](http://twitter.com/EamonLeonard), organizer of the magical [Funconf](/blog/funconf-fuck-yeah.html), to do the keynote. But we both overestimated the chances of that happening, since his wife was pregnant and about to give birth weeks after that Friday - Eamon ended up canceling it roughly 16 hours before the time he was supposed to give it. I'm very happy he did, because she [gave birth](https://twitter.com/EamonLeonard/status/323004437436182528) to their first child on Saturday morning, the next day after the supposed keynote. I'm happy because if Eamon was to come, I would be a dead man now.

He sent us this [video](http://vimeo.com/63903883) instead, which after a few weeks of processing in my head means way more than it might have been intended to. You see, I've met Eamon at a conference some years ago and it is only at conferences when I have a chance to see him. How many people you have met at conferences would do something like this for you? Chances are not a lot, and that's why conferences like ours are so great. What we care about the most, and what my keynote was about, is the fact that it is all about the people.

Of course it is great to brag about how many thousands attendees a conference has and all the extremely well known speakers it brings, but what is the value of that to a normal attendee? ~None. We brought a hundred people interested in technology, new things and expanding their network, locked them up them in a castle for 24 hours and let them take it from there. There was nothing else to do or to go to apart from spending the time with fellow attendees.

We also brought back the [shark](http://www.flickr.com/photos/juokaz/7094198697/in/set-72157629490197160) this year. Apart from being awesome at everything, which is one thing thing - floating in the air, it is extremely sensitive to air temperature of the air. So if you calibrate its weight in a cold room, it will not be heavy enough in a warm room and get stuck on the ceiling. Something we learned only after it did so. It then took us well over an hour to get it down, after many many attempts by everyone. I was standing back and admiring the interest of everyone to take care of it.

Everyone had a chance to talk to everyone, speakers included - they weren't hiding in a closed room just for the speakers, they were always part of the group. At some point during my keynote I mentioned that I expect everyone to leave with at least one new person they would hug the next time they meet. I know I did. A few people asked me why is this our goal and why we didn't focus on the talks themselves, because at the end of the day, that's what conferences are supposed to be about?

Talks are important, and we of course had them, but conferences are a terrible place to learn. One hour talks are way too short to fit a lot of content in and it's also near impossible to judge the experience level of your audience so they tend to be very vague. And that's ok, because they provide an overview of the topic, which you then can research more later. More important to most people is the opportunity to discuss various tech topics with other people. Even if they don't know it yet. That's our job.

I've traveled the world quite a lot and lately I've been meeting with people I only knew online or just met once at some event more and more. For example in Melbourne I gave a short talk at the PHP meetup there after which I got an email saying "I [read](/blog/your-three-ugly-friends.html) you like cocktail bars, these are my favorites here". I had no one to go with, so I invited him and joined by another local we went out to have a great night. All because we had a common profession? No. Because that's what you do.

The people you meet at a conference might end up being your friends. When we organized the first Whisky Web, pretty much all of the speakers and sponsors were the people we collectively knew. It was less the case this year, but roughly half of the speakers were invited almost without any long consideration. We knew them well enough to know they can deliver. And that's how we got the speakers we got, because we trusted them and they trusted us.

We needed people to trust us, because we are weird. Or different. When I asked Eamon to deliver his keynote at the top of the [Arthur's Seat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur's_Seat,_Edinburgh) his reaction was, rightfully, not very inspiring. But I convinced him that would work, even though we dropped that idea some time later because it would just be too risky. All the people who came to attended also trusted us enough to come with a small bag of things packed and see where that would take them.

It was a shared trust. After much discussion about the lack of diversity in conferences and recent [anti-harassment](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) policies we also had one. If you were to do anything, I would use a golf club to break your knees. It took everyone 5 seconds to realize what I meant by that. Which is? This would never happen at Whisky Web, and if did, one would just get thrown out from an event which was supposed to be a venue to make friends.

It was the best conference ever (this phrase sounds way better in an American teenage girl voice). Subjective of me to say so, but I really enjoyed all of it myself and there are so many stories I can tell, I will be talking about this the rest of the year. Why do I think my opening talk was the worst keynote ever? Because it was unprepared and chaotic. But the ones who saw it understood the honesty and passion behind what we do, and that's what made it great. And maybe saved me from getting arrested.
