While literally married co-founders is quite a rare phenomenon. The relationships in startups are going to require practically the same sort of commitment.

There are websites and apps which help you to find one. Tinder for founders no less. I don’t think that’s a good way to find one. As I also don’t think marrying someone I just met in a bar is a clever plan. Both of these sound like the things which happen in Las Vegas. I hope it’s clear - going into business with someone you barely know is very risky. It might mean a lot of wasted resources and time just to realize that your visions are misaligned. I wouldn’t do it with anyone I don’t know for at least a few years.

The things you need to know are how someone is dealing with finances, what are their work hours, how good are they at the job, etc. Finances being the one which will start to matter a lot when it becomes a *business*. It takes time to uncover those. Nowadays a lot of post-“Social Network” people are excited about the idea of building startups. But that doesn’t make them good entrepreneurs out of the gate. Spending time with the future team to crystalize the shared dream is key.

Founders don’t have to follow any schedules, clock-in and out or show up at the office. Any one of them can decide to take a 3 month vacation and no one else has any powers to change that. It’s not a job and none of the rules which would otherwise apply to an employee matter. To fix this, before any work gets done a shareholder agreement should be put in place. Defining that everyone’s ownership is only there if they keep doing the agreed job.

It’s important to agree on responsibilities early on. Having 5 founding members all dong “*stuff*” is not going to work. Everyone has to own a slice of the operations. Someone gets the tech, someone marketing and someone also has to be the chief. This makes the team much more effective and avoids two characters clashing on who does what. Of course this all can change in the future, but avoiding “I thought I was the CTO?!” discussions is great.

Killer team is by far the biggest success factor for a startup. It’s not a team when an idea-character finds a technical founder to build the thing. Or when a technical character finds a sales character to get the sales. Someone in this team is just a glorified employee, but yet with a major ownership in the idea. If you are lacking in skills and thought about finding a co-founder to help out, think about hiring one instead. It will still be a team, but if you are building your vision, you won’t have hired business partners. I know that bringing co-founders in is a $-free way to get employees, but that’s weak.

This won’t be a problem for as long as the startup is small. When it’s small nothing is a problem outside of the product being bad. But come success, and everyone wants as much of the pie as possible. All of a sudden the technical character brought in to build the app wants more responsibilities. Or the sales one is clearly leading the company, but the technical idea-creator doesn’t want to give up his CEO seat.

What happens then? Companies are not easy to divorce. The small ones are easy still, because the market value is less than a macbook. But with enough momentum it’s big enough to have some serious value, which no one wants to give up. So companies get sold or dissolved because of founders’ conflicts extremely often. It’s not like you can stock-dilute left and right like the Social Network makes it appear. Everyone is in for a very long time.

For most “real” companies with boards and long email signatures, this is not a problem. Even the people who hate each other beyond repair can make it work. Because ultimately it’s not about the single characters, but the business itself. However for startups the business is the founders.

The only way to push through the 1,000’s of feet of mud until success is with the team who act like one.

When the company is young and no decisions have critical impact, it’s easy enough to work with anyone. But small idiosyncrasies are only going to get multiplied later on. Founders are in for the long-term gains, make sure the team you are in are aligned on it.
