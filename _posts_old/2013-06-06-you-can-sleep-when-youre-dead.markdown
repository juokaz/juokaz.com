title: You can sleep when you're dead
location: Vilnius, Lithuania
excerpt: Roughly two years ago I used to sleep 4 hours a day. 3 hours a night and then 3 more times 20 minutes each. The goal was to sleep 20 minutes 6 times a day, reducing the total sleeping time to 2 hours. The naive ambition was because of common belief that you really don't need to sleep a lot and you should not waste your time on such mundane things like sleep.

Roughly two years ago I used to sleep 4 hours a day. 3 hours a night and then 3 more times 20 minutes each. The goal was to sleep 20 minutes 6 times a day, reducing the total sleeping time to 2 hours. The naive ambition was because of common belief that you really don't need to sleep a lot and you should not waste your time on such mundane things like sleep.

These are called [alternative sleeping cycles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep) and there are quite some people using them. After the initial days of pain it becomes quite an easy scheme to follow, the problem though is that you have to keep following it. To the minute. Which is very hard unless you live by yourself, work from home and have a full control of your time. Most people can't, for example I travel all time, and if you miss a sleeping slot the whole thing collapses.

Furthermore, it is really like being drunk. People go driving cars because they actually think they are capable of doing so.While you are drunk, your judgment becomes flawed and it is only when you sober up you realize that you were not doing great the whole time.  It is the same with the alternative sleeping cycles - it feels like you are doing great and being very productive while doing so - but once you stop doing it you start to question if you were actually any better off. In theory you should be always rested and at the top of your performance, but I'm not entirely sure why would you want to be like that for 20 hours a day.

It is great to get a lot of work done, but it is unrealistic to even assume that there is a direct correlation between the hours you are up and the amount of work you get done. At some point I was barely sleeping at all, doing a few 3 day runs without any sleep at all, which I all spent working practically 3 jobs. That wasn't fun. Took a while to realize though. You are doing a lot of *work*, but the quality of it is again very questionable. And once you start falling asleep while typing something, you could spend hours sitting in front of your computer and get nothing done.

What you are looking for, is how to be the most rested the time you are up. It doesn't matter if that's 16 hours or 12. If during that time you don't feel sleepy at all and can perform at your best, you don't need any of those brutal sleeping cycles. The problem though is that it is hard to feel good the whole time people are up. Most people wake up tired and need, or actually think they need, coffee to get their day started. Sleeping quality is something which you need to make sure you have set up right, but people don't feel sleepy because of it being bad - they feel sleepy because they don't want to be awake.

Let me paint you a picture. For free! Imagine you need to wake up for a 6AM flight, so unless you have nailed the airport process, you will be up at 4AM or so to have enough time to make it to the airport. That little bit of stress is going to make you feel alive and you won't have problems staying awake the whole day. You won't even feel tired. But imagine sleeping-in on a Sunday and you can barely open your eyes at 11AM. Also you might not even feel well rested the whole day.

As far as I can tell, most sleeping disorders and problems are caused by the lack of motivation. If deep down you know that the whole day is going to be a boring routine at work, deep down your brain has no interest, or motivation specifically, to wake you up. But if you are 7 years old and it is the Christmas eve you will be wide awake at 5AM. Because every piece of your body knows that something great is going to happen that day. This is always the case - the best and maybe the only way to feel great and not tired is to have motivation.

If I wake up later than 10AM I feel like I have missed the day, because by that time a lot of things have happened already and I just slept past them. I'm like that. This tends to happen because of transatlantic travel. When you don't sleep that much anyway and you need to readjust to a new timezone you end up falling asleep while having dinner. If you are staying at one timezone for most of the time, you can achieve great sleep rhythm by making sure to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day.

There are more suggestions to increase sleep quality, drinking cold water and sleeping in a complete darkness are a few of them, but the most important one is making sure your body knows when you are going to go to sleep. Once you start doing this, you can keep decreasing the sleeping time, if you wish, up to a point when you don't sleep that much, but still feel absolutely great. There is a common belief that [programmers like to work at night](http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198). The same sort of nonsense that all of them need coffee to get work done. Two stereotypes caused by nothing more than laziness and lack of good sleep. Mornings are great, and if you are looking for quiet time, even more quiet than working at night.

One of the getting-things-done practices is to go over the tasks for tomorrow before you fall asleep. Only takes a minute to do so, but is both great for preparing for what is going to come and also for exciting yourself about the things waiting to happen tomorrow. That might help. A friend of mine used to sleep 16 hours a day, every day, because she had nothing to do during the day - she was a student and during the summer she was plain bored. Eventually these sort of things sometimes lead to depression.

It is a popular thing to brag about how little one sleeps and how that apparently implies the amount of work getting done. Especially by the startup guys. Sleeping time doesn't really matter. What matters is being able to wake up feeling rested and ready to rock. And that only takes having a reason to wake up, a good one, all the other sleep quality altering tricks are worthless. And I've tried them all.
